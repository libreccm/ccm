    <h2>Clickstream Analysis</h2>
    <hr/>
    Both <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">AWStats</a> and <a
    href="http://www.quest.com/funnel_web/analyzer/">Funnel Web
    Analyzer</a> were able to process the access logs generated by the
    <a href="http://www.caucho.com/">Resin</a> and <a
    href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a> servlet
    containers.  These tools generate a wide range of statistics about
    usage of a site, including most popular pages, entry and exit
    pages, session duration, browser types, referring sites, and much
    more.  However, neither of these tools, nor any of the other
    open-source log analysis tools investigated did
    clickstream/clickpath analysis.  The only tools capable of this
    type of analysis were either commerical products or real-time
    subscription services.
