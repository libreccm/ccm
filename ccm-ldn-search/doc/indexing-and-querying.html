    <h2>Content Indexing and Querying using interMedia and Lucene</h2>
    <hr/>
    This document will outline how CMS content is indexed, and how a
    search string is translated into a set of results with both Lucene
    and Oracle interMedia (also known as Oracle Text).

    <h3>Indexing</h3>

    <h4>Basic Attributes</h4>
      Both interMedia and Lucene store the same set of basic attributes
      about a piece of content that are used for filtering a search
      query or displaying search results.  These attributes are also
      used to match search query terms when using Lucene, but not when
      using interMedia.  Attributes include:
      <ul>
        <li>Object ID</li>
        <li>Object type</li>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Summary</li>
        <li>Language</li>
        <li>Content creator</li>
        <li>Creation date</li>
        <li>Last user to modify content</li>
        <li>Last modification date</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Full Text</h4>
      The content that is full-text indexed is created by traversing the
      object graph and generating a representation that is
      usable by the indexer.  This
      is handled by an implementation of <a
      href="http://ccm.redhat.com/documentation/api/ccm-core-6.0.0/com/arsdigita/domain/DomainObjectTraversal.html">
      DomainObjectTraversal</a>.  The set of objects to be visited by
      the traversal is configurable by editing the file indicated by
      the <code>com.arsdigita.cms.item_adapters</code> configuration
      parameter (it defaults to:
      <code>WEB-INF/resources/cms-item-adapters.xml</code>).

      <p/>
      This file contains a set of <code>contexts</code>, which are
      used to group adapter directives for different purposes.  The
      <code>context</context> used for indexing is
      <code>com.arsdigita.cms.search.ContentPageMetadataProvider</code>.
      Within this <code>context</code> there a number of
      <code>adapters</code>.  Each <code>adapter</code> specifies a
      list of attributes and associations that should be handled by
      the DomainObjectTraversal for the given <code>object
      type</code>.  Each of these lists also has an adapter
      <code>rule</code>.  If the <code>rule</code> equals
      <code>include</code>, then the list is an inclusion list, and
      only attributes (or associations) listed will be processed by
      the DomainObjectTraversal.  If the rule equals
      <code>exclude</code>, then it is an exclusion list, and all
      attributes (or associations) will be processed except for those
      listed.
      
      <p/>
      When indexing an object for Lucene, the
      <code>DomainObjectTraversal</code> converts all processed
      attributes into their string values, concatenates them into
      one long space-separated string, and passes that string to
      Lucene for indexing.  The details of how Lucene handles this
      data is beyond the scope of this document, but you can read the
      documentation available from the official <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html">Lucene</a>
      project page for more information.

      <p/>
      When indexing an object for interMedia, the set of traversed
      objects is converted to an XML document.  The object being
      indexed is processed recursively, with the root object
      creating the first element, and all attributes and associated objects
      creating new child elements.  This XML document is then inserted
      into a database table that has been indexed to allow for
      efficient searching of XML data.

      <p/>
      interMedia also allows for indexing of raw content - plain text and binary
      data (Word, PDF, etc).  When using interMedia an additional
      traversal is performed, collecting any associated text or binary
      assets.  The rules for which attributes and associations are
      visited during this traversal are contained in
      <code>com.arsdigita.cms.search.AssetExtractor</code>
      <code>context</code>.  The content of the first asset found is
      inserted into another column that is indexed using interMedia.
      If that content is plain text or one of the interMedia-supported
      binary file types, it will also be used when performing
      searches.  Oracle provides a <a
      href="http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/B10501_01/text.920/a96518/afilsupt.htm#CCREF1300">list</a>
      of supported document formats.

      <h3>Querying</h3>

      <h4>Lucene</h4>
      Human-entered search terms are passed directly to the Lucene
      APIs to be parsed and matched against the search index.  The
      Lucene documentation explains the <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html">query
      syntax</a> and matching rules in detail.

      <h4>interMedia</h4>
      interMedia is more restrictive about the queries it will accept,
      and an incorrectly formatted query can cause an error.  To avoid
      this, the human-entered search terms are first "cleaned" by
      removing illegal words and characters and separating the
      remaining words and phrases (words surrounded by quotes, which
      will be search for as a group) with "and".  Illegal characters
      are: <code>|&amp;,-*;{}%_$?!()\:@.&lt;&gt;#^+=[]~`</code> and
      illegal words are: <code>the, of, to, with, and, or, for,
      this</code>.  This set of cleaned search terms is then used to
      query the columns containing the XML and raw content we
      generated earlier.  The query is performed using the interMedia
      <code>contains()</code> operator.  This operator uses the
      interMedia indexes on these columns to perform efficient
      full-text searching.  The rank for each search result is
      obtained by multiplying the value of the <code>score()</code>
      operator for the XML and raw content columns by the weights
      specified in the
      <code>waf.search.intermedia.xml_content_weight</code> and
      <code>waf.search.intermedia.raw_content_weight</code> config
      paratemers respectively, and summing the resulting values. Both
      config parameters default to <code>1</code>.  Detailed
      information on the use of the <code>contains()</code> and
      <code>score()</code> operators is <a
      href="http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/B10501_01/text.920/a96518/csql.htm#21732">provided</a>
      by Oracle.  Note that, as a result of the "cleaning" of the
      search terms, advanced interMedia search features are not
      supported.  Only simple matching of all specified words and
      phrases is currently supported.

      <p/>
      Because full-text searching with interMedia is done against a
      table in the same schema as the rest of the CMS data (as opposed
      to the external files used by Lucene), it enables filtering
      based on permissions and categories, which is not available to
      Lucene.  When filtering based on permissions, the search query
      is modified to join with the permissions-denormalization tables
      and filter out any objects for which the specified user
      (generally the currently logged-in user) does not have the
      specified privilege.  For category-based filtering, the search
      query joins with the categorization tables to filter out any
      objects not in the specified categories.
