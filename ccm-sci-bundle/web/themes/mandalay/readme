Mandalay
========

This will be a complete new theme for RedHatCMS /
Byline / Aplaws+ build up from scratch.

Design goals are to build a modular box-layout-based theme
integrating all functions from the cms which will be styled
by changing css files and xml-based settings.


Some hints for this theme:
--------------------------

* Each content type have exactly one xsl file in the types directory, which will do all the processing
  * This file will include templates for all view (detailed, listed, ...)
* shared functions like Processing of image attachments will be located in seperate files in the include directory
* templates will be defined with name and match clause, where aprop
* css file go in the css sub folder structur
  * for each media type, there will be a folder on first level
    * for each content type there will be al folder on second level
    * also, there will be a folder for global css settings in second level
    * in these folder on second level there are 4 css files: basic.css, enhanced.css, ie-hacks.css and admin.css
      * basic.css uses css styles, which will work in all css capable browsers
      * enhanced.css uses css styles, which will work with modern browsers (Firefox, Konqueror,...)
      * ie-hacks.css uses special css styles, which will correct the flaws of MSIE
      * admin.css uses css styles, which will be needed by admin ui
* setting for personalization are located in the settings directory
* localized static text are read from the xml-files in the lang folder
