Purpose:
This subdir is an optional default, pre-configured location for a custom theme, 
which is included in / added to a distribution.

In unmanaged (without ccm-themedirector installed) mode it is at first searched 
for a theme. If none is found, the bundle default (scicms-defaault) is used.

In managed mode (with ccm-themedirector installed) the parameter 
themedirector.default_theme_path=themes/scicms-[custom|default]
is used to select between custom or bundle default.

All files and subdirectories are copied asis to the applications ~/themes 
directory in its document (context) root.

It is the responsibility of the developer / system integrator to ensure all files
are copied to the right location and the theme works with the modification. No
functionality or consistency check is performed!
