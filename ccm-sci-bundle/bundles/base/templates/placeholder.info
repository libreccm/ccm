The installation program copies all sub-directories and files in this directory 
into the applications webapps subdirectory templates. 

Subdirectory  <navigation> may optionally contain navigation item templates for
navigation index pages which either overwrite or ammend those templates
which are default for ccm-sci-bundle and stored in 
   /web/templates/ccm-navigation/navigation

Templates of the same name in this subdirectory just overwrite the
default files. Templates of different names are stored in addition
to the default template files. In the later case a developer must
provide a customised template.txt file replacing the default file
   /src/WEB-INF/navigation/templates.txt
This file must be specified in parameter 
   com.arsdigita.navigation.templates_file
It usually stored in res/bundle/navigation
