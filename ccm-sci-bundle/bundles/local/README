This directory should host custom site specific bundles which are not
to be stored in the central software repository.

For each site specific bundle a subdirectory should be created which 
in turn hosts the bundles subdirectories cfg, res, templates and themes.

Example:
 
~/local/mysite
~/local/mysite/cfg
~/local/mysite/res
~/local/mysite/templates
~/local/mysite/themes

This site specific bundle is activated in local.ccm.properties by:

> ccm.bundle.folder=${ccm.project.dir}/ccm-sci-bundle/bundles/local/mysite

By default subversion is configured to ignore all unversioned lower case 
names in this directory so the directory mysite will not be stored in 
repository. 

Instead it is recommended to store the bundle either in a seperate 
respository or in its own branch in the repository, eg.

> svn import -m 'Save mysite.' mysite  https://myrepo.dom/svn/bundles/mysite

If other versioning systems are used their configuration should be created
accordingly.
