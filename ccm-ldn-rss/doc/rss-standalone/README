Up to APLAWS version 1.0.4 rss had been installed into its own
application context: [webapps]/ccm-ldn-rss.

Now it is installed inside the main APLAWS application context along
with all other applications.

If rss should be installed as its own web context again following
modifications are necessary:
1.  remove webapp="xxx" from application.xml
2.  move the files in this dir to WEB-INF/
3.  change src/com/ad/london/rss/RSS.java 
    method getServletContext() as back to "/files"
4.  edit __ccm__/.../xsl/index.xsl according the comment


Running it in its own webapplication context nevertheless is not suggestive.
It needs several xsl files of the main application (esp. core) for basic
operations, which had been directly mapped from the main applications directory
tree into its own directory tree. So no module separation is possible, no
security context useable etc.
