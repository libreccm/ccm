Up to APLAWS version 1.0.4 subsite had been installed into its own
application context: [webapps]/ccm-ldn-subsite.

Now it is installed inside the main APLAWS application context along
with all other applications.

Also, ccm-ldn-subsite is renamed to ccm-subsite.

If shortcuts should be installed as its own web context again following
modifications are necessary:
1.  remove webapp="xxx" from application.xml
2.  move the files in this dir to WEB-INF/
3.  change src/com/ad/subsite/Subsite.java 
    method getServletContext() as back to "/files"
4.  edit themes/.../xsl/index.xsl according the comment
5.  edit in ccm-ldn-aplaws /web/themes/static/aplaws/subsite.xml
    according to the comment
6.  Add the filter expression in web.xml-subsite.in into the
    main applications web.xml

Running it in its own webapplication context nevertheless is not suggestive.
It needs several xsl files of the main application (esp. core) for basic
operations, which hac been directly mapped from the main applications directory
tree into its own directory tree. So no module separation is possible, no
security context useable etc.
