/**

 * The SciPublications package provides several functions for working
 * with the Publication content types provided by the ccm-sci-publications
 * module.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This includes exporters for reference management software and imports
 * from such formats. Examples are BibTeX and RIS.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The entry point for all functions is provided by the
 * <code>SciPublications</code>
 * application and the <code>SciPublicationsServlet</code>. The application
 * makes heavy use of the {@link ServiceLoader} class which was introduced in
 * Java 1.6.
