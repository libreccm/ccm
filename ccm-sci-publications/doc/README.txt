The ccm-sci-publications module
===============================

The ccm-sci-publications module provides several content types for
managing publications. The content types and forms have no special
characteristics, except that they are using many associations between
them. For displaying nice lists of publications, a special template is
necessary, together with support in the theme for the XML produced by
the template. 

The key is the activate the specialize object feature in the item
lists. An example for a template for publication lists can be found in
the ccm-zes-aplaws module. The Mandalay theme supports publications
since revision 161.
