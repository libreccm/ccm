  The forum ui package provides the GUI for users of the forum. Another package
  provides the GUI for administrators

<p>
    <i>AForumUserCompactView.java</i> is the main entry class. It creates a
    rather CCM specific compact view into the forum, showing all threads without
    regard of their topic, but enabling to filter the list for specific topics.
    In the future their may be a more convenient view as an alternative.
