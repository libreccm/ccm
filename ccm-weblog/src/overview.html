    <h1>Package WebLog</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
    <p>
    Weblog provides a Blogging facility. The package provides a portlet 
    (“WebLog Portlet”) to display and edit a blog. Each blogging entry 
    has the structure of an CCM article: Title, lead, and body. A reader 
    can create comments to each blogging entry.
    </p>


    <h2>2. Status</h2>
    <p>
    Under evaluation.
    </p>

    <p>
    Application is supported by the default internal theme, not by the 
    APLAWS standard theme. Currently only English is available for public 
    site and admin UI.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Recommendations </h2>¶
    <p>
    The application requires a portal to display the blog. So the site must 
    at least use one portal page (e.g. the front page at root).
    </p>
    <p>
    As an alternative the blog can be displayed on its own page, but can not 
    be integrated into the navigation menue (Navigation application).
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Additional Application Details</h2>
    <p>
    By default the blogging page shows a list of all blog entries by title 
    and lead (abstract) and provides a “more” link the a details page which 
    contains the complete text and all comments. This page enables the reader 
    to add a comment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently no information about permission management!
    </p>


    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
    Before a blog can be used, an instance of WebLog must be created using 
    one of the administration facilities. By default one instance is created 
    at admin/blog, e.g. http://my.domain/ccm/admin/blog.
    </p>
    <p>
    To display the blog on a portal page, an instance of WebLog portlet must 
    be installed on a portal page. It's installation UI provides (besides the 
    standard properties title and description) a drop-down list to select the 
    list provider, “/admin/blog” in case of the default installation in the 
    above example.
    </p>
    <p>
    For each additional, separate blog it is necessary to install an additional 
    WebLog instance. This may be done using the UI at ~/portal/admin/sitemap.jsp 
    or the administration UI of portalserver's ~/ccm/administration portal page. 
    It is good practice to install the WebLog UI beyond admin of eventually 
    the default content section.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Guess:</b> An instance may not installed as root application.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additional instances of WebLog portlet have to be installed with (one of) 
    the additionally installed WebLog application instance(s) selected as 
    provider.
