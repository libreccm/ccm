<p>This is a subfunction use case for the View Help summary use case (<a href="psrv-00710.xml.html">PSRV-00710</a>).</p>

<p>The Portal Participant can search the complete set of Help pages for those pages that have been associated with a specific keyword.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>This capability does not have the priority to be completed for version 1. It will be included in version 2.</p>
