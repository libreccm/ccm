   <title>Lifecycles</title>

  <body bgcolor="white">

    <p>Provides a set of classes to manage and apply lifecycles to
    {@link com.arsdigita.cms.ContentItem content items}.</p>

    <p>The lifecycle engine is used to control the post-production
    processing of a content item.  It is flexible enough to handle
    automatic scheduling of multiple deployment stages.</p>

    <p>CMS uses the concept of lifecycles and phases to model the
    deployment of content items. A {@link
    com.arsdigita.cms.lifecycle.Lifecycle} is a period of time in
    which a content item is deployed. Each lifecycle is associated
    with a start time and, optionally, a stop time.  {@link
    com.arsdigita.cms.lifecycle.Phase Phases} are relevant time
    periods within a particular lifeycle. Like a lifecycle, each phase
    is associated with a start time and, optionally, an end time. The
    start time of the earliest phase within a lifecycle is the start
    time of that life cycle; the end time of the latest phase within a
    lifecycle is the end time of that lifecycle. The phases in a
    lifecycle need not be contiguous and can overlap with other
    phases.</p>

    <p>Templates are used to generalize a class of lifecycles and
    phases.  The relation between {@link
    com.arsdigita.cms.lifecycle.LifecycleDefinition lifecycle
    templates} and {@link com.arsdigita.cms.lifecycle.PhaseDefinition
    phase templates} is analogous to that of lifecycles and
    phases. Phase templates differ only slightly from the actual
    phases.  Instead of having a start and end time, phase templates
    are associated with a delay and duration. The delay is the length
    of time of from the start of the lifecycle up to the time that the
    phase becomes active. The duration is the length of time that the
    phase remains active.</p>
