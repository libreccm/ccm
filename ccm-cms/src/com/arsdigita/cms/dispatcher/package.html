    <p>Provides a set of classes that serves requests to the Content
    Management System.</p>


    <h3>The Rendering Pipeline</h3>

    <p>The processing of the request happens in three stages:</p>

    <ol>

      <li><p>The incoming request is passed from the main dispatcher
      to the {@link com.arsdigita.cms.dispatcher.CMSDispatcher}, and
      from that to an {@link
      com.arsdigita.cms.dispatcher.ItemResolver}, which extracts
      information from the URL and instantiates a content item object
      on the server.</p></li>

      <li><p>The content item domain object is transformed by an
      {@link com.arsdigita.cms.dispatcher.XMLGenerator} into an XML
      document fragment, which becomes part of the overall XML
      document for the page.</p></li>

      <li><p>The XML document is passed off to the XSL transformation
      engine, which applies XSLT templates to the XML document,
      generating the final output that is sent back to the
      user.</p></li>

    </ol>

    <p>Many parts of this rendering pipeline are common to all CCM
    pages: the treatment of the incoming URL by a cascading set of
    {@link com.arsdigita.dispatcher.Dispatcher dispatchers}, the
    generation of an XML document as an intermediate,
    output-independent representation of the page, and the
    transformation of that intermediate representation by the XSL
    engine.</p>
