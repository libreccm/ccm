    <p>The Publish-To-Filesystem(P2FS) 
      service writes published content to the file system so that
      another webserver (e.g. Apache) can serve this content without
      further intervention by CMS. This makes it possible to build highly
      scalable live servers that are not bound by factors such as database load.
    </p>
    
    <p>Whenever content in CMS is published or unpublished, a corresponding
      task is scheduled with P2FS to update the file system
      appropriately. The {@link
      com.arsdigita.cms.publishToFile.QueueManager queue manager}
      periodically checks this queue and processes all entries in it. An
      item is (re)published by requesting its live version from the
      editorial server through HTTP. The returned content is the scanned
      for links to other items (by looking for <tt>oid</tt> attributes in
      certain HTML tags). The links are rewritten to properly work on the
      targetted live server (see the <tt>destination</tt> parameter
      below). In addition to the main HTML file for an item, P2FS will also
      write all associated local assets of the item to the file system.
    </p>

    <p>P2FS deployments will have some kind of shared storage between
    the application server running CMS/P2FS and the web server serving published
    content.  One typical example is for P2FS to publish to a directory that is
    NFS-shared between the application server and the web server.  Then, when
    the application server writes new content the to file system, it will show
    up under the web server.  Another possible configuration is for the
    application server and web server to be located on the same physical
    machine.  Then, the web server could simply link to the directory to which
    P2FS is writing content.
    </p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p> To use P2FS, you need to add a
      <tt>com.arsdigita.cms.publishToFile.Initializer</tt> entry to your
      <tt>enterprise.init</tt>.  For example:
    </p>
<!-- Completely outdated"
- entzerprise.init no longer used
- new template location is /templates/ccm-cms/content-section               -->
    <pre>
init com.arsdigita.cms.publishToFile.Initializer {
    destination = { 
      { "com.arsdigita.cms.ContentItem", 
        "/var/p2fs", 
        false, 
        "/var/p2fs" },
      { "com.arsdigita.cms.Template", 
        "/packages/content-section/templates", 
        false, 
        "/packages/content-section/templates" }
    };
    publishListener = "com.arsdigita.cms.publishToFile.PublishToFile";
    startupDelay = 30;
    pollDelay = 5;
    retryDelay = 120;
    blockSize = 40;
    maximumFailCount = 10;
    blockSelectMethod = "GroupByParent";
}
    </pre>

    <p>The first parameter, <tt>destination</tt>,
     is a list of publish destinations for content types. 
     Each element in the <tt>desitnation</tt> list is a four-element list in the
     format:
     <br>
     <tt>
     '{ "content type", "root directory", "shared storage", "url stub" }'. 
     </tt>
     <br>
     Content type is the object type of the content type. 
     Root directory must be a path to a writable directory, relative 
     to the webapp root. Shared storage must be <em>true</em> if the root 
     directory is shared NFS storage, <em>false</em> otherwise. URL stub
     must be the path component of the URL from which the live server 
     will serve from this directory.
    </p>
    
    <p>The <tt>publishListener</tt> must name a class that implements
      {@link com.arsdigita.cms.publishToFile.PublishToFileListener
      PublishToFileListener}. The listener is called whenever changes to
      the file system need to be made. It is strongly recommended that the
      listener in fact subclasses {@link
      com.arsdigita.cms.publishToFile.PublishToFile PublishToFile}, since
      most of the basic P2FS functionality is provided by this class.
    </p>

    <p>
      The remaining parameters control how the queue of items that need to
      be written to the file system is processed. Queue processing will
      start <tt>startupDelay</tt> seconds after the server start, and the
      queue will be polled for neew entries every <tt>pollDelay</tt>
      seconds. If <tt>startupDelay</tt> is set to 0, queue processing is
      <em>completely disabled</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>The queue manager will process <tt>blockSize</tt> queue entries
      within one database transaction. Setting this parameter to a higher
      value can speed up the overall P2FS performance, but will also consume
      more memory during processing.
    </p>
    
    <p>If processing a queue entry fails for any reason, the processing is
      retried after <tt>retryDelay</tt> seconds. Entries that could not
      successfully be processed after <tt>maximumFailCount</tt> will remain
      in the queue, but will be ignored. Processing an entry can fail for a
      variety of reasons, for example because the target file system is
      full, or because the content could not be retrieved from the
      editorial server through an HTTP request. The server log will contain
      more detailed information about all procesing failures.
    </p>
    
    <p>The <tt>blockSelectMethod</tt> must always be set to
      <tt>GroupByParent</tt>.
    </p>

    <h3>Multi-JVM Deployment</h3>
    
    <p>If CMS is run on multiple JVMS (servlet containers), the queue
      processor <em>must</em> be disabled on all but one of these servers
      by setting <tt>startupDelay</tt> to 0. It is not possible to have
      several servers process the queue at the same time.
    </p>

    <h2>Enabling Templates for P2FS</h2>
    <p>P2FS scans all content for the HTML tags <tt>&lt;a&gt;</tt>,
      <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt>, and &lt;link&gt;. Any such tags that contain an
      <tt>oid</tt> attribute will be rewritten by P2FS and adjusted to the
      configured publishing destination. The <tt>oid</tt> attribute must
      contain the ID of the target content item. For example, the fragment
    </p>
    <pre>              &lt;a oid="425"&gt;Another Item&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
    <p>will be rewritten by P2FS so that the HTML link points to the
      correct file on the destination live server for the content item with
      ID 425.
    </p>

    <p>P2FS uses the <tt>ContentType</tt> HTTP header it received when it
      requested the live item to determine the file extension of the main
      file written for an item. Currently, the following content types are
      supported:
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr bgcolor="grey">
          <th>Content Type</th>
          <th>File Extension</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>text/html</tt></td>
          <td><tt>.html</tt></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>text/plain</tt></td>
          <td><tt>.txt</tt></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>application/php</tt></td>
          <td><tt>.php</tt></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>application/xml</tt></td>
          <td><tt>.xml</tt></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>other</td>
          <td><tt>.html</tt></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </body>
