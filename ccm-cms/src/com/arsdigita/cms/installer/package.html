    <p>Provides a set of classes to install and initialize the Content
    Management System.</p>

    <p>There are two common types of files:</p>

    <ol>

      <li><p><b>Installers</b> - These classes contain the code to
      install the Content Management System and mount content
      sections.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Initializers</b> - These classes are run at server
      startup and are used to install the Content Management System if
      it has not already been installed. For the most part,
      initializers call the installers' methods.</p></li>

    </ol>
