<!--
   - The Resin configuration file.
   -
   - This example file is more complicated than is needs to be because
   - it makes several configurations explicit that can be simplified and
   - because it needs to configure the examples.
   -
   - Look in conf/samples for more realistic sample configurations.
   -   conf/samples/simple.conf - a simple, basic configuration
   -   conf/samples/deploy.conf - a simple configuration for deployment
   -
   - The configuration is based on a purely element-based XML.  To make
   - it easier to read, attributes can be used as syntactic sugar.
   -
   - The following are equivalent:
   - <foo><bar>13</bar></foo>  - canonical representation, but verbose
   - <foo bar=13/>             - typical configuration
   - <foo><bar id=13/></foo>   - sometimes useful
