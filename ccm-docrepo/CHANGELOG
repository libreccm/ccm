Package ccm-docrepo is now initialized as a new style, legacy free application.
An update is not necessary because has not been part of distribution yet.

==============

Package ccm-docmgr from Byline repository copied and integrated in ccm/aplaws
as an test environment.
This "old" docmgr worked nearly out of the box (in contrast to "new" docmgr.

Plan: Integrate "old" docmgr as a simple doc repository for files. To distinguish
it from the advanced version provided by Magpie (which is based on the old code
but heavily extended) it should be renamed to ccm-docrepo or
ccm-filerepository / ccm-documentrepository
