Create a directory nbproject in the base dir of your APLAWS devel
environment (usually trunk). Copy the file project.xml into that
directory.

Open Netbeans, open a new project, select freeform web project
with existing ANT file, choose your devel directory. Netbeans 
will find the project file and create a new project which contains
all APLAWS packages.
