dev-lib/
  set of external libraries requirred by CCM at runtime and usually
  provided by the runtime environment (e.g. servlet api).
 
  Provided as additional classpath element at compile time 
  (and probably in test environment)

  All libraries included in application.xml as 
    <dependencies>
      <ccm:buildRequires name=.... />
    </dependencies>
  MUST be placed here.

  Some files may be copied into the runtime environment to simulated
  the intended production runtime.
