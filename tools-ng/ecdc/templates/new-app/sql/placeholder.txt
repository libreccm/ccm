   
This directory contains the custom SQL files that create, drop,
aand upgrade the database schema for an application, and a single 
custom create script ("oracle-se-create.sql", for example) for each 
supported database. 

SQL files are organized by package and by the database they are 
appropriate for. Note that auto generated sql, which is what most of 
your sql will be, only appears in the build and deployment directories,
not in this sql/ directory!
