Here we provide source rpms to create a rpm based Tomcat distribution which 
just installs the original Apache Tomcat distribution in a rpm system and
FSH compatible manner (i.e. install into /usr/share/tomcatX, /etc/tomcatX, ...)

Tomcat as distributed by jPackage.org, Red Hat, SuSE and others replace some  
libraries of the Apache Tomcat distribution by (hopefully) equivalent general
Java packages and place them for system-wide usage (and indepentend updates)
into /usr/share/java directory tree. Furthermore they inject extra capabilities,
which may not been desired and may conflict with a CCM installation. Also, 
system wide installed jars introduce dependencies from other programs and 
you may end up in the well known "dependency hell". 

This causes trouble in some circumstances.

The source rpm creates a self contained distribution which is just dependent
on a Java installation.
