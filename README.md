LibreCCM is a framework for creating content oriented web applications with

Some examples are the APLAWS+ and ScientificCMS.
APLAWS+ is content management system created for local  authorities in the 
United Kingdom. ScientificCMS is a web content management system tailored
for requirements of scientific research insitute, developed by a team
at the University of Bremen. 

For historical reasons this repository contains the sources for LibreCCM,
LibreCMS (a build containing all modules for common web pages), ScientificCMS
and APLAWS+. 

We are currently migrating the system to Jakarta EE 8. As part of this migration
the we spliting up the sources of the projects. The Jakarta EE 8 based sources
can be found at in the [LibreCCM repository](https://github.com/libreccm/libreccm). The sources for 
ScientificCMS can be found in the [ScientificCMS repository](https://github.com/libreccm/scientificcms).

This version of LibreCCM uses an Ant based build system. For instructions how 
to set up this build system please refer to the [README](tools-ng/README) file 
in the tools-ng directory.
