Warning: This no longer works with the current version of RHL.  Please refer to Xresources.txt.

In your .Xdefaults file, you'll find entries for the display
properties of Emacs. If you wish, you can substitute those entries
with the following, which will give you a larger Emacs window, and
change the default color of the background, cursor and pointer.
