  <para>
    &PROD; is designed to use a three-button mouse.  If you have a two-button
    mouse, you should have selected three-button emulation during the
    installation process.  If you're using three-button emulation, pressing
    both mouse buttons at the same time equates to pressing the missing
    third (middle) button.

  <para>
    In this document, if you are instructed to click with the mouse on
    something, that means click the left mouse button.  If you need to use
    the middle or right mouse button, that will be explicitly stated.
    (This will be reversed if you've configured your mouse to be used by a
    left handed person.)

    The phrase "drag and drop" may be familiar to you.  If you're instructed
    to drag and drop an item on your GUI desktop, click on something and
    hold the mouse button down.  While continuing to hold down the mouse
    button, drag the item by moving the mouse to a new location.  When
    you've reached the desired location, release the mouse button to drop
    the item.
