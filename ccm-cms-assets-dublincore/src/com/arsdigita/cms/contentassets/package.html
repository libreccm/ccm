    "Dublin Core" is a set of 15 generic elements for describing resources:
    Creator, Contributor, Publisher, Title, Date, Language, Format, Subject, 
    Description, Identifier, Relation, Source, Type, Coverage, and Rights.
    These are name the "Dublin Core Metadata Elemenmt Set (DCES) created in
    1995, currently at version 1.1 (2012)
</p>
<p>
    According to the Dublin Core initiative it is about more than those 15 
    elements. It is part of the "Semantic Weg" approach. The initative 
    developed "DCMI Metadata Terms", which is a larger set that includes the 
    15 elements along with several dozen related properties and classes. They
    constitute an "application profile" which uses DCMI metadata terms together 
    with terms from other, more specialized vocabularies to describe a specific 
    type of information

<p>
    The CCM DublinCore asset is an implementation of the Dublin Core Metadata 
    Element Set, version 1.1 (revision 2012). For detailed information see the
    <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">element set reference guide</a>.
    It is meant to be expandable to serve as a base for a domain  or user specific
    and more complex set of metadata or an application profile.
</p>
<p>
    <i>DublinCoreItem.java</i> is the main domain class.
