Template: ccm/shared/ccm_load_apps_at_install_p
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Load CCM applications as they install?
 You could choose to load CCM applications into the database 
 automatically after they are installed, or you could load them 
 manually [with 'ccm load'] yourself.
 .
 The former will save you some manual work, while the latter is probably
 most suited if you are trying to build the applications from the
 sources and prefer to load them once all are built and installed.

Template: ccm/shared/pg_set_up_database_p
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you want me to set up the CCM database and adjust the access permissions?
 You have specified a database on your localhost. I could set it up
 for you and automatically adjust the access permissions. I could do
 this independently of whether or not you have choosen to load the
 applications at install time.
 .
 Say no here if you have already prepared the CCM database yourself
 or if you would like to do it later. Saying yes will save you some
 manual work.

Template: ccm/shared/error_etc_ccm_missing_dir
Type: note
Description: CCM configuration directory does not exist.
 I couldn't find the CCM configuration directory: /etc/ccm.
 .
 This probably points at a corrupt or unusual CCM installation. The ccm-tools
 package creates this directory --- please verify that it is installed and 
 intact.
 .
 I will continue with the configuration by re-creating the directory,
 but we may experience problems later.

Template: ccm/shared/ccm_aux_setupdb_failed
Type: note
Description: ccm-aux-setupdb couldn't complete.
 The helper script ccm-aux-setupdb didn't succeed.
 This means that the CCM database couldn't be set up.
 .
 If you have answered yes to the automatic loading of 
 applications at install time, I will still try to honour 
 that.
 .
 In case that doesn't succeed [likely now], please manually 
 prepare the database and load the application(s) after the 
 installation.

Template: ccm/shared/ccm_aux_update_hba_conf_failed
Type: note
Description: ccm-aux-update-hba-conf couldn't complete.
 The helper script ccm-aux-update-hba-conf didn't succeed.
 This means that the access permissions for the ccm database 
 couldn't be set up.
 .
 If you have answered yes to the automatic loading of 
 applications at install time, I will still try to honour 
 that.
 .
 In case that doesn't succeed [likely now], please manually 
 check/edit the pg_hba.conf file of your PostgreSQL instance 
 and load the application(s) after the installation.

Template: ccm/shared/error_ccm_tool_not_found
Type: note
Description: The 'ccm' tool not found.
 I need the 'ccm' tool [/usr/bin/ccm] to continue but I cannot find it. 
 .
 This probably points at a corrupt or unusual CCM installation. The ccm-tools
 package contains this file --- please check your setup after the installation, 
 and then run "dpkg-reconfigure ccm-core".

Template: ccm/shared/error_java_home_not_found
Type: note

 "dpkg-reconfigure ccm-core".
