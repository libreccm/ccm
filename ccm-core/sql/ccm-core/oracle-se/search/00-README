The files in this directory contain the data model and
procedures for search.

To load everything do: 

sqlplus < search-create.sql

To drop everything do:

sqlplus < search-drop.sql


WARNING:  Dropping everything will also drop the table that stores
content that is indexed (table search_content, see SearchContent-create.sql).
There is currently no easy way to recreate the contents of that table. 
So in general, never run the search-drop script if you have content that
is currently searchable and you want to keep searchable.

Instead, If there are problems with a search index (hopefully that
will not happen) the index can be dropped and rebuilt using:

sqlplus
@search-index-drop.sql
@search-index-create.sql

But this should only be done when the server is not running, otherwise
there could be conflicts with automatic rebuilds.
