        <h1>CSS files</h1>
        <main>
            <p>
                The system for loading CSS files is similar to the system for finding layout 
                templates. Which CSS files are loaded for a page is determined by the 
                <code>conf/css-files.xml</code>. The root element of this file is an 
                <code>css-files</code> element. This element has multiple <code>application</code>
                child elements. Each <code>application</code> has an mandatory attribute 
                <code>name</code> which contains the name of the application for which the CSS files 
                named in the element are loaded. There should be also an <code>default</code> 
                element which determines the CSS files to load when no matching 
                <code>application</code> element is found.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name of an application is generated as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the data tree contains an <code>application</code> attribute the value of
                    this attribute is used as name of the current application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there is no <code>application</code> but an <code>class</code> attribute the
                    value of the <code>class</code> attribute is used as name of the current
                    application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there is no <code>application</code> and no <code>class</code> attribute
                    the name of the current application is set to <code>none</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each <code>application</code> element and the <code>default</code> element 
                in <code>css-files.xml</code> can contain multiple <code>css-file</code> element. 
                Each of the <code>css-file</code> elements defines a single XML to load.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>css-file</code> element has two optional attributes:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>media</dt>
                <dd>
                    The media type, for example <code>screen</code> or <code>print</code> for 
                    which the CSS file is used. The value of this attribute will appear in the
                    media attribute of the <code>link</code> element which is generated in the HTML
                    to load the CSS file.
                </dd>
                <dt>origin</dt>
                <dd>
                    The origin of the CSS file. If not set the file is loaded from the current 
                    theme. If set to <code>master</code> the file is loaded from the master theme 
                    if the current theme is a child theme. If set to <code>internal</code> the 
                    file is loaded from the internal directory for CSS files, either from the
                    current theme (if the current theme is a master theme) or from the Foundry
                    master theme installed at <code>/themes/foundry</code>.
                </dd>
            </dl>
