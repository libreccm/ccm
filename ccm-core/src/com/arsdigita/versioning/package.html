Provides for versioning of data objects.

<p>We refer to the previous implementations of the versioning package
as the "old versioning".  This includes implementations up to and
including 5.2.x.  If you have used the old versioning before, there is
a number of key differences between old versioning and this
implementation that you may want to be aware of.
</p>

<p>The old versioning operates on the {@link
com.arsdigita.domain.DomainObject domain object} level. Only those
domain objects that subclass <code>VersionedACSObject</code> used to
be versioned.
</p>

<p>This implementation operates on the {@link
com.arsdigita.persistence.DataObject data object} level. In order to
make an object type versioned, its PDL definition must start with the
"versioned" keyword, like so:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
versioned object type Quux {
   BigInteger[1..1] id  = quuces.id INTEGER;

   String[1..1]   name  = quuces.name VARCHAR;

   object type (id);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Object types may also be versioned implicitly due to semantic
constraints imposed by marking some other object type as "versioned".
For example, a subtype of a versioned object type is also versioned.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
object type GreatQuux extends Quux {
   String[0..1] email  = great_quuces.email VARCHAR;

   component Foobar[0..n] foobars = join great_quuces.id
                                      to foobars.great_quux_id;
   reference key(great_quuces.id);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this example, the <code>GreatQuux</code> object type is
versioned, because it extends a versioned type. </p>

<p>Components of a versioned type are also versioned. In the above
example, the <code>Foobar</code> type is versioned, because it is a
component of the versioned object type <code>GreatQuux</code>.
</p>

<p>A more complete description of the supported PDL syntax and its
intended semantics is outside the scope of this brief description.
Please refer to the Developer Guide for further details.
</p>

<p>About the only carryover from the old versioning is the {@link
com.arsdigita.versioning.VersionedACSObject} class.  It has been
marked as deprecated.  It may be removed in a future release.  You
should not be using or relying on any of the API provided by this
class.
