<p>
Provides a Dispatcher implementation that is backed by the "Site Map" of
SiteNode domain objects. The reason this package is not part of the
Kernel is that the Kernel, being pure application logic, must have no
dependencies on the Presentation Infrastructure (of which the
Dispatcher framework is a part). Thus, this package is what connects
SiteNodes (which are part of the Kernel) to the Dispatcher system.
