<title>ArsDigita JDOM API Wrapper</title>

<body bgcolor="white">

<p>
    
A set of wrapper classes around the DOM API that emulate the
critical-path elements of the <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a>
API. Only the functions necessary for integration with Bebop are
included, so support for certain features (such as real support for
Namespaces) isn't present and won't be until Core moves to real JDOM
(if it does).

</p>

<p>

The functionality of the classes in this package closely mirror that of 
actual JDOM classes.  This should ease the transition to real JDOM - 
ideally, we should be able to replace <code>com.arsdigita.xml</code> with
<code>org.jdom</code> and be up and running with JDOM in minutes.
