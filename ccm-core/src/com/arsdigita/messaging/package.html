Messaging provides a standard set of abstractions for creating and
storing messages. Messaging applications constitute some of the most
useful forms of web collaboration, and many of the application
packages that have been developed for CCM have a messaging
component. The messaging service provides a convenient mechanism for
these web applications to create messages, attach other content to
them (images, files), and schedule messages for delivery to recipients
using other services like email notification.
