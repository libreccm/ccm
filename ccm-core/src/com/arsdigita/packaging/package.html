Set of classes which provide a command line interface to install, initialize 
and configure a CCM application instance with MasterTool.java as the central
entry point.

<p>
Mastertool.java is the central entry point. It delegates the different tasks 
to specialized worker classes.
</p>
<p>
The classes of this package are meant not to be called from within the 
application running in a servlet container. They serve as a dedicated, 
separate external command line interface for set up and configuration.
