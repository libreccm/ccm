The Form Builder UI provides a number of embeddable bebop components
to facilitate integration of the form builder service with applications.
The main components for applications to use are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>ControlEditor - a component for editing the controls on a
persistent form section. The form section to be editted is passed
in through a selection model.
<li>ProcessListenerEditor - a component for controlling the process
listeners added to a form section. The form section to be altered
is passed in through a selection model.
</ul>

<p>
Both these components are very configurable, allowing the forms
used for adding / editing widets to be totally customized on a per
application basis. The default implementations of these forms 
for all the bebop widgets can found inthe com.arsdigita.formbuilder.ui.editors
package. New controls can be registered using the widgetTypes and
processListenerTypes parameters in the enterprise.init.in (see the
standard file for example entries).
</p>

<p>
For an example use of the form builder UI components take a look
at the FormItem content type and its authoring kit in the CMS
application.
