The Form Builder service provides the ability to build simple forms
with a web user interface. The applications will be responsible for
adding the persisted form to an appropriate page. Persisted forms are
retrieved via their ACSObject Id (an integer). The Form Builder
supports persisting most of the commonly used form components and form
listeners. Form listeners are persisted via their class name and it is
thus not possible to persist listeners implemented via anonymous inner
classes. The admin UI of the Form Builder allows Form Components
to be edited, added, inserted, moved or deleted from a form with a
simple layout.
