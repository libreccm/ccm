<p>Provides a set of classes to store metadata about data object types
and the database schema used to persist data objects. </p>

<p> When the system starts up, the persistence layer reads the PDL
files into an Abstract Syntax Tree using the files within {@link
com.redhat.persistence.pdl.nodes}.  The Abstract Syntax Tree
then populates the classes within this package.  These classes are
then used by the operational persistence layer (the classes within the
{@link com.arsdigita.persistence} package) to perform the standard
operations.  </p>

<p> The resulting structure is a hierarchy as every item that can be
represented in PDL extends the {@link
com.arsdigita.persistence.metadata.Element} class.  This class stores
general information about object models and is able to output itself
in the form of a PDL file.  </p>

<p> The metadata is divided into {@link
com.arsdigita.persistence.metadata.Model}s.  These models act as the
namespace for all of the metadata information (such as object types,
data queries, and data operations).  The model itself is composed of
{@link com.arsdigita.persistence.metadata.ModelElement}s. </p>

<p> There are two types of ModelElements: {@link
com.arsdigita.persistence.metadata.Association} and {@link
com.arsdigita.persistence.metadata.DataType}.  The Association model
type holds information for associations between object types.  The
DataType model contains both CompoundTypes and SimpleTypes.  </p>

<p>
{@link com.arsdigita.persistence.metadata.SimpleType}s are used to
represent the primitive DataTypes that the persistence layer knows
how to store.  For instance, there are SimpleTypes for BigDecimal,
Integer, Date, and String as well as many others.  These are used
for describing Properties as well as Attributes defined
within MAP blocks.
</p>

<p> A {@link com.arsdigita.persistence.metadata.CompoundType} can
be a {@link com.arsdigita.persistence.metadata.ObjectType}.
ObjectTypes
provide specific access special events that act on rows within the
tables.  Each {@link com.arsdigita.persistence.DataObject} contains a
single ObjectType and that ObjectType is what contains references to
the events allowing the user to easily manipulate data within the
database.  An ObjectType is made up of Attributes (columns in the
database), Associations (mappings between database tables), and Events
(A collection of Operations that dictate how information is stored and
retrieved within the database).  </p>

<p> A QueryType is composed of a set of Operations and {@link
com.redhat.persistence.metadata.Mapping}s that allow the user
to retrieve arbitrary information from the database.  </p>
