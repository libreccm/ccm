The classes in this package provide an API for creating and
manipulating Data Objects. These classes fall into two categories. The
<b>External Interfaces</b> which are used by code outside the
persistence layer to create, retrieve, and manipulate data objects and
queries.

</p>
    
    <h3>External Interface</h3>


    <ul>
      <li><b>DataObject</b>

          <p>The DataObject interface is how a DataObject
          presents itself for use to code outside the persistence
          layer. This interface represents a single data object. It
          may be used to modify the properties of the data object
          and retrieve any DataAssociations the data object
          may have.</p>

      <li><b>DataAssociation</b>

          <p>The DataAssociation interface is what a
          DataObject returns when its getProperty() method is
          called with the name of a role. The DataAssociation
          interface may be used to add and remove items from the association.
          It also has a method, <code>cursor</code>, that returns
          a <code>DataAssociationCursor</code> object that allows
          the programmer to iterate through the objects (and associated
          LinkAttributes) associated with the parent DataObject.
          </p>

      <li><b>DataCollection</b>

          <p>This interface is similar to DataAssociationCursor, in
          that it allows you to iterate through a collection of
          objects, but the collection need not represent an
          association between two objects.</p>

      <li><b>DataQuery</b>

          <p>This interface is used to access the results of a free
          form query against the object model, such as might be
          necessary in order to generate a complicated report.  It also
          allows the developer to write free-form queries that return
          data objects.  This is useful for situations where the standard
          persistence events do not do exactly what is desired or do not
          provide the needed performance optimizations.</p></li>

      <li><b>Filter</b>
          <p>
          This is the interface used to allow user's to filter the results
          returned by DataQueries, DataCollections, and DataAssociationCursors.
          It allows user's to set a condition and set values for bind variables
          used within those conditions.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>FilterFactory</b>
          <p>
          This creates various types of filters, including filters that
          can be combined together.  While Filter's can only contain
          a specific condition, the FitlerFactory has the ability to return
          CompoundFilters that an combine fitlers with each other.  It also
          has many convenience methods that allow users to create filters
          without worrying about which database is being used (using
          them eliminates oracle's problem with "null" values).
          </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>OID</b>
          <p>
          An OID describes a given DataObject.  Specifically, it holds the
          type of the data object so that the persistence system knows which
          object type to use when persistening the object and it also holds
          values for key properties so that the system knows which values
          to use to identify the specific row represented by the object.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Link</b>
          <p>
          The Link class is used to represent the relationship between
          two object types.  This is the same terminology that is used within
          UML.  Links may contain properties (e.g. the property isDefault could
          be used to indicate whether this is the defaut link for the object).
          </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Session</b>
          <p>
          All persistence operations take place within the context of
          a session.  The operational persistence methods operate on
          the object types and associations defined in the Persistence
          Definition Langauge (PDL) files.  The Session object has the
          operational methods for creating and retrieving data objects.  The
          APIs that operate on the PDL-defined metadata are in the <a
          href="metadata/package-frame.html">metadata</a> package.
          The Session object can
          be retrieved from the static <a
          href="SessionManager.html#getSession()"|>SessionManager.getSession()</a>
          method.

          </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>TransactionContext</b>
          <p>
          This is the context of a given transaction.  More concretely,
          this provides user's with the ability to begin, commite, abort,
          and rollback transactions.  Most developer's will not need to
          deal with this class as the ACS handles transaction management
          within its dispatcher.
          </p>
      </li>
</ul>
