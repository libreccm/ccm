  <body bgcolor="white">

    <p>A set of server-side user
      interface components for web
      applications. The user interface components are similar to those of
      traditional GUIs, such as 
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/index.html">Sun's
      Swing</a>.</p>
     <p>To learn how Bebop works, start with the documentation for the class {@link
      com.arsdigita.bebop.Page <code>Page</code>}, the top level container
      of all Bebop components.
    </p>
    
    <h3>State management</h3>
    <p>Bebop makes the creation and use of stateful user interface
      components easy. It helps developers of such components manage the
      state of one component (for example, a tabbed pane) in a transparent
      and isolated way. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Nested Containers</h3>
    <p>Bebop components and containers can be nested arbitrarily deep. For
      example, it is possible to build a page that contains a {@link
      com.arsdigita.bebop.TabbedPane} that contains a {@link
      com.arsdigita.bebop.Form} that contains a {@link
      com.arsdigita.bebop.Table} that contains a checkbox widget in every
      row.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Static and request-specific objects</h3> 
    <p> Every Bebop component lets you split the underlying data structures
      into two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Static</b> parts are those that are common to 
	every request to the page, for example a form and the widgets it
	contains.</li>
      <li><b>Request-specific</b> parts are those that depend on the
	individual request, for example the values that a user fills into
	the form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> The static part of a page can be built once and then be reused for
      all the requests to the page. This initialization is typically
      done in the <code>init</code> method of a servlet. Classes that
      contain only static information implement the interface {@link
      com.arsdigita.bebop.util.Lockable}.</P>
     <P>Request-specific data structures
      are built within the <code>doPost</code> or <code>doGet</code>
      methods of a servlet. Corresponding to the static <code>Page</code>,
      there is a {@link com.arsdigita.bebop.PageState} class that will
      carry all the request-specific information connected to the
      <code>Page</code>. If your application needs to modify parts of a
      <code>Page</code> during a request, you need to build the page in the
      servlet's <code>doPost</code> or <code>doGet</code> methods.
    </p>

    <p> As a simple example, consider a page that displays a login
      screen. The login screen is a form that accepts a
      <code>screen_name</code> and a <code>password</code>. The static part of
      the page consists of building up the component hierarchy and locking
      it. This code would typically be in the <code>init</code> method of a
      servlet:</p>

    <pre  style="background: #cccccc; padding-top: 6pt">
    <span style="color: gray">// Create a text widget for screen_name which can not be empty.</span>
    Text screenName = new Text("screen_name");
    screenName.addValidationListener(new NotNullValidationListener());
    <span style="color: gray">// Create a text widget for the password which can not be empty.</span>
    Password password = new Password("password");
    password.addValidationListener(new NotNullValidationListener());
    <span style="color: gray">// Set up the form</span>
    Form form = new Form("aForm");
    form.add(screenName);
    form.add(password);
    <span style="color: gray">// Add a (hypothetical) custom password checker</span>
    form.addValidationListener(new PasswordChecker(screenName, password));
    <span style="color: gray">// Add a listener that forwards the user to his workspace</span>
    form.addProcessListener(new SendUserToWorkspace());
    <span style="color: gray">// Add the form to the page and signal that its building is finished:</span>
    Page page = new Page();
    page.add(f);
    page.lock();
</pre>
    <p> The last line of the above example is very important: </p>

    <p>The call to {@link com.arsdigita.bebop.Page#lock} locks the
      page and guarantees that no further modification to its
      structure is possible.</p>


    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p> The simplest use of this page in the <code>doPost</code> or
      <code>doGet</code> method of the servlet consists of a single call:</p>
  <pre  style="background: #cccccc; padding-top: 6pt">
    page.service(request, response)
  </pre>
    <p> The {@link com.arsdigita.bebop.Page#process Page.process} method
      will initiate all the steps that are necessary to process the
      request. It notifies the form that a request has been made and prints
      the page that results from the form that processes the request.</P>
     <p>To process the request, the form extracts the parameter values from
      the request, runs validation listeners, and either runs process listeners
      (if the request was a valid submission) or displays the form together
      with error messages (if the request was not a valid submission).</p>
