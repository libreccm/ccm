Notification provides the application-level capabilities needed for
outbound email.  It allows any Message object to be sent to a CCM
User or Group. When sending HTML fragments it performs intelligent
conversion to plain text.  It also allows applications to create and
manage digests for their users.  Notification builds on the Messaging
and Mail services.
