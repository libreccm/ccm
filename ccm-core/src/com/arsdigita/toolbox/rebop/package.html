"Rebop" is a lightweight collection of AWT-based components suitable
      for using in applet development. Applets written using these
      components should look and behave consistently across all
      version 4 and higher browsers. JDK 1.1 support is required, as
      the rebop components take advantage of the lightweight component
      and container classes introduced with this JDK revision.<p>

The rebop components are only as complete as required by the chat
      applet. It is hoped that any further applet development (for
      example, collaborative tools like whiteboards) will continue to
      build out the rebop framework.<p>

Rebop is not intended to be a replacement for the Swing GUI
      framework. If you are able to use JDK 1.2 or higher, Swing is a
      higher-performance and more flexible option.<p>
<em>Features:</em><p>
<ul>
<li>Each component can given its own Drawable object, which will be
        painted automatically. Currently StyledText, GenericImage and
        BevelBox support the GenericDrawable interface.</li>
<li>Components paint transparently over each other, allowing them to
        be combined into more complex components.</li>
<li>All components are derived from java.awt.Container and thus may
        contain sub-components and layout managers</li>
</ul>
