    <p>Provides a set of classes to instantiate metadata objects from
    an XML file. The XML tags used correspond almost directly to the
    classes in the metadata package. 
    </p>

    <h3>Sample code</h3> 
    <p> 

    Sample code can be found in the junit tests for this
    package. There are three sample XML files defining simple object
    types and their physical schemas. Note that these three examples
    use the same dtd
    (test/com/arsdigita/persistence/metadata/xml/metadata.dtd). The
    following examples are provided:

    <ul>

      <p><li> XMLParserTest: Defines the <code>acs_object</code> and
      party object types.

      <p><li> XMLOrderTest: Defines an Orders object type composed of
      1 or more line items. These two object types are used in unit
      tests for the {@link com.arsdigita.persistence} package.

      <p><li> XMLWeirdReferencingTest: Defines two identical tables
      composed of one column each. Each table's primary key references
      itself and the other table. This example shows how to model
      foreign keys and also demonstrates that we support the same sort
      of circular foreign keys as Oracle.

    </ul>
