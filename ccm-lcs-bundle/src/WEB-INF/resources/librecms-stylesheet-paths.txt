# This file locates stylesheets, if you are using the
# "PatternStylesheetResolver". Please read the Javadoc for that file for
# the full story.

# Currently the "resource" part is actually "short-circuited", see 
# Templating#transformURL(url). As long as we store and synchronize all theme
# files in each server's local file system, we use the direct file apprach to
# avoid unnecessary http request and traffic between client (user) and server!
# Additionally all modules are installed into one webapp context, so the
# webapp tag is redundant, but sort of required by some part of the code.
