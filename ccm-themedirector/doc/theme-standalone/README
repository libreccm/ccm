As of CCM version 6.6.1 package ccm-ldn-themes became a generic package and
has been renamed to ccm-themedirector.
All names below and anywhere in the files should be adopted accordingly.

Up to APLAWS version 1.0.4 theme had been installed into its own
application context: [webapps]/ccm-ldn-theme.

Now it is installed inside the main APLAWS application context along
with all other applications.

If shortcuts should be installed as its own web context again following
modifications are necessary:
1.  remove webapp="xxx" from application.xml
2.  move the files in this dir to WEB-INF/
3.  change src/com/ad/london/theme/ThemeApplication.java 
    method getServletContext() as back to "/files"
4.  edit __ccm__/.../xsl/index.xsl according the comment
5.  edit in ccm-ldn-aplaws /web/__ccm__/themes/aplaws/theme.xml
    according to the comment


Running it in its own webapplication context nevertheless is not suggestive.
It needs several xsl files of the main application (esp. core) for basic
operations, which hac been directly mapped from the main applications directory
tree into its own directory tree. So no module separation is possible, no
security context useable etc.
