      economic well being, but clearly cannot do this on its own. As a result
    it has come
      together with a number of organisations such as the Job Centre Plus, the
      Learning and
  Skills Council, the Chamber of Commerce and Business Link.</p><p>Our economic aims are simply
    to:</p><ul>
    <li title="*">Improve the wealth creating
    capacity of the area. </li>
<li title="*">Improve access residents
    have to the wealth created.</li>
<li title="*">Keep as much wealth as possible within the area.</li>
</ul><p>A simple set of aims but not
  easy to achieve.   </p><p>We  commission research
    and to make sure that information and analysis was widely available and understood.
    Its purpose
  is to improve our understanding of the economy, and to identify the
issues facing the local population and workforce.</p><p>  Its work programme presently includes: </p><ul>
<li title="*">Household
          Survey: Covering issues such as economic activity, unemployment, 
hidden unemployment, wage rates, and skills and qualification levels.</li>
<li title="*">Employer Survey: Covering
          issues such as business confidence, skills and 
qualification needs, exporting, and investment.</li>
<li title="*">Establishment of a comprehensive
    database of employers in the county.</li>
<li title="*">Labour Market Assessment
          and Economic Forecasting: Summarising the 
present state of the local economy, outlining trends and forecasting future 
trends. </li>
</ul><p>Accurate and up to date analysis and data is a prerequisite to effective economic
  development within the county as it informs policy development and is essential
  for identifying priorities. Robust data at the local level is also essential
  in the bidding process for a variety of national and European funding programmes.
  These programmes also require such data at the local level for effective monitoring.
  Potential inward investors also regularly request such information.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
