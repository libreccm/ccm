An alternative is 'to go it together' and start a co-operative</i></p><hr/><p>
				A co-operative is an easy way for two or more people to go into business together. The way co-operatives are set up reduces personal financial risk.
			</p><p>
				In a co-operative everyone who comes to work
	    for the business, and remains with it, is given a say in how the firm
	    is run and a share in the profits and ownership. We can help you set
	    up a new
    co-operative in any sector by providing:
			</p><ul>
			<li title="*">Tailored business counselling and advice</li>
<li title="*">Help with business planning</li>
<li title="*">Design of legal structures and documentation</li>
<li title="*">Assistance with accessing finance</li>
<li title="*">Helping with finding premises and equipment
        and identifying suppliers</li>
<li title="*">Information services</li>
</ul><h2>
				Existing Co-operatives
			</h2><p>
				We can continue to support co-operatives and
    other employee owned businesses once they start trading, helping them to
    strengthen
    their business and achieve long-term survival.
			</p><p>
				Co-operatives are not left to sink or swim once they start trading. They are offered expert support as their businesses grow, enter new markets, experience difficulties or identify training needs.
			</p><p>
					Health checks can be carried out to provide an overview of how the business is performing and where it is heading.
				</p><p>
				Business information can be provided including company searches, on-line information, reference texts, journals, and videos.
			</p><p>
				Small businesses that adopt a co-operative structure are twice as likely to survive the critical first three years compared to sole traders or partnerships.
