A well considered and constructed business plan can help you safeguard your own investment, focus your efforts, ease external financing problems and provide you with a yardstick against which to measure your progress. Once developed you should aim to maintain your business plan in-line with your business. </i></p><hr/><p>Writing
    a Business Plan is essential but it is not as difficult as it may sound -
it is simply a way of putting your ideas on paper.</p><p>Areas that are usually covered:</p><li title="*">Description of the business - brief overview
              of purpose of business and location. </li><li title="*">Evidence of demand for product/service - size
              and location of market, buying patterns, type of research carried out. </li><li title="*">Sales and Marketing - how you will promote
              your product/service, sales targets you've set, competition and how you
              will overcome it. </li><li title="*">Product/Service - description and its advantages
              (and disadvantages). </li><li title="*">Management - CV's, training needed, what are
              these people bringing into business? </li><li title="*">Financial forecasts - cash flow forecast,
              profit and loss, initial financial outlay</li><p>Your plan should contain the essential information
    required - not waffle. Try and tailor it to the needs of whoever is going
    to be looking at it. And remember, with financial predictions - best to be
    prudent - don't be over-optimistic!</p><p>You can obtain examples of business plans from:</p><ul>
