    a new business start-up. Because it is funded by government and private sponsorship

			<strong>Franchises</strong>
		</p><p>There are around 600 businesses in the UK that
are franchised but what is franchising and would it be suitable for you?</p><p>It's a way of setting up in business for yourself
but not on your own. With a franchise you run the business, but using methods
that have been already tried and tested by another company, called the
franchisor.</p><p>It is a way of being your own boss without many
of the risk factors. However, you are ultimately answerable to the
franchisor and this approach may not be for some people.</p><p>There are a large number of websites that deal
with selling franchises a small number are listed below:</p><ul>

			Do I need planning permission?</h2><p>Planning holds a balance between the need for
    new development and the need to protect the environment and tries to ensure

approvals.More information can be found on the

Control</strong>

		</p><p>
			<strong>Working from home</strong>
		</p><p>
You do not usually need planning permission just to work from home but
  sometimes you do.</p><p>The key test is whether the residence has changed
    because of the business. If the answer to any of the following questions
  is &quot;yes&quot;, then you will probably need permission:</p><ul>
			<li title="*"> Is
  your house no longer chiefly a private residence?</li>
			<li title="*"> Will
  your business result in a marked rise in traffic, people calling or working
  around the house or in out buildings?</li>
			<li title="*">Will
  your business involve obvious activities not usual in a residential street?</li>
			<li title="*">Will
your business disturb your neighbours because of noise or smells?</li>
		</ul><p>  Basically you need to ask yourself if the house is still mainly a home
          or has it become business premises? This is whatever the business, including using a room as an
  office, hairdressing, repairing cars, storing goods, using part of the house as
  a bedsit, running a &quot;bed and breakfast&quot;, providing childminding or
  music teaching.
