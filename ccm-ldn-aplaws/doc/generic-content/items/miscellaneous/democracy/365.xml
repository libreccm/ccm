You can be a candidate if you are over 21, on the electoral register, and have lived, worked or owned property in the area for at least the past 12 months. </p><p>You may be disqualified as a candidate if you work for The Council or hold a politically restricted post with another local authority. Bankruptcy or a previous criminal conviction with a three-month or more prison sentence would also disqualify you as a candidate. </p><p>Most candidates are nominated through a political party. However, individuals are welcome to stand in their own right. Before you can be accepted as a candidate you must get one person to agree to propose your nomination, another person to agree to second the proposal. Both of these people must be on the electoral register. </p><p>The nominations for the Elections are as follows:</p><table width="90%" cellpadding="5" class="centre" summary="list of nominations">
