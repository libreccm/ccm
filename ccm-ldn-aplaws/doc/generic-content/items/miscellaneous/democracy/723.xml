District and County Council, however they maintain a close working relationship with both.  The powers of Parishes vary depending on how large and how active they are.  Some meet infrequently (but at least four times a year, including one public meeting) and are responsible for very few matters.  Other, larger, parishes undertake many duties such as street lighting, managing cemeteries, allotments, commons, village halls, war memorials and markets etc.</p><h2>Parish Councillors</h2><p> Councillors have an active interest and concern for their local community. They represent local people and work in partnership with them and others when necessary. They help facilitate the provision of local services and facilities and take decisions that form the policy of the Council. </p><p> Councillors are not paid and have to abide by a local government code of conduct and declare their financial interests in the parish. Councillors must also declare a personal or prejudicial interest in any matter under discussion at a parish council meeting.</p><p>For more information, see
