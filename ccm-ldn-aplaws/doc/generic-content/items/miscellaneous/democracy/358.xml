The council is run on a system similar to that at central government, with an executive to make major policies and councillors to scrutinise or examine these decisions in detail. </p><h2>What do Councillors do?</h2><p>Your councillor is the person elected every 4 years to represent your area. </p><p>They can help if you are dissatisfied with a council service by advising or directing you to someone who can help sort out your problem and can sometimes progress the case on your behalf. This is often done in advice surgeries where you can meet with the councillor for your ward and discuss your problem. </p><p>As community leaders they put forward proposals to improve their ward, which may include bringing together different community groups to develop a case for change. </p><h2>Who is my Councillor? </h2><p>The following list gives you the names and photographs of your Councillors, together with a brief profile, details of their roles and responsibilities, their annual reports and contact details. </p><table width="90%" cellpadding="5" class="centre" summary="councillor details">
