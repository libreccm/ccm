			</h2><p>
				New Deal is a key part of the government's Welfare 
to Work strategy. Personalised programmes of work and skills training opportunities, 
delivered locally, are aimed at helping unemployed people into work. There are 
programmes for young people (18-24), 25+, lone parents, disabled people, 50+ and 
partners of the unemployed.
			</p><p>
				All programmes are accessible through Employment 
  Services and, whether you are an unemployed individual looking for a job or 
  a company with vacancies to offer, your first point of contact should be your 
  local Job Centre.
