However, if any tenant becomes aware of squatters in a property that they know should be vacant, perhaps one tenant has moved out and another has not yet moved in, we would be grateful if the tenant would advise us and we can then commence the action.  This applies generally to unknown and suspicious occupants.  The Council cannot be expected to know what is happening in all the properties that it owns and we greatly appreciate the information we receive from our tenants. </p><p>If you see anyone suspicious or who appears to be squatting in a property please use the contact details above so that we can resolve the matter quickly. Any contact will be strictly confidential.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
