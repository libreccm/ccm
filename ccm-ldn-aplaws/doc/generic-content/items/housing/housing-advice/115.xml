There are always a number available to rent at any time at competitive rates. Garages are for personal private use only and not for commercial activities. </i></p><hr/><p>Anyone can apply to rent a council garage but we give priority to existing Council tenants. You will not be offered a garage if you have rent arrears. </p><p>If you would like to apply for a garage please contact us on the details above and you will be sent an application form. Once you have completed the Garage Application form, you will be entered on the appropriate list and we will advise you when your turn is reached. How long you have to wait for a garage depends on the site you want and how many other people are waiting. </p><p>Council garages are intended for the storage of a motor vehicle. They are not sufficiently weathertight or secure for the storage of any other goods. You should not store petrol or any other inflammable materials in your garage. You should not sublet your garage to anyone else. </p><p>We require four weeks advance notice if you want to give up your garage. When you give us back the keys the garage should be empty and swept through. We will charge you if we have to clear it. </p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
