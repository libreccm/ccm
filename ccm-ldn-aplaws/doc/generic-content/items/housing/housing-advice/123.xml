Unfortunately this is not the case. We strongly advises all Council Tenants to take out household contents insurance in some form. 
</i></p><hr/><p>As a Tenant you are entitled to insure the contents of you Council 
  house with an insurance company of your choice. The Council does offer tenants comprehensive 
  insurance cover within its own Home Contents Insurance Scheme.</p><p>Application forms can be obtained from us by telephoning us 
  on the above number or any local Housing Centre.</p><p>For an informal chat about the scheme you can contact us using 
  the details above.</p><h2>How do I make a claim on my Home Contents Insurance?</h2><p>If you take out insurance cover under our Home Contents Insurance Scheme, you will need to obtain an official claim form from any of the 
  local Housing Offices. Once you have completed the form you will need to send it 
  to the Council's Insurance Brokers (see reverse of the form for address details).</p><p>If you have queries with your claim form, please contact the 
  us using the details above.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
