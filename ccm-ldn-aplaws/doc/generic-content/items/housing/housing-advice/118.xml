  too long, the Council may decide to repossess the garage. </i></p><hr/><p>Unlike house and flats, 
  the Council do not have to apply to courts for a Possession Order.</p><p>The Council operates a policy of automatic repossession should a third Notice to 
  Quit be served on a garage regardless of whether the account is subsequently cleared.</p><p>Should a garage be repossessed and be found to contain goods, the tenant will be 
  contacted and asked to removed them. Should the Council have to clear the garage, 
  the cost of the clearance along with the cost of a lock change should one have been 
  necessary, will be charged to the former tenant. This is in addition to any arrears 
  outstanding.</p><p>Most arrears cases can be dealt with relatively simply provided tenants get in 
  contact early enough. Ignoring the situation can only make matters worse.</p><p>Due to the low level of rent compared to a house or flat, some may regard garage 
  rent as low priority. However we have a duty to 
  recover all rent owed to the Council to fund the services we provide. We are also 
  required to maintain overall levels of outstanding rent including garage rent, within 
  limits set by Central Government.</p><p>There may also be a waiting list for garages in your area. Please contact us for 
  more details.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
