We can help you: </p><ul>
				<li title="*">
<strong>set up and run your home well: </strong> turning on gas; electricity and water; finding furniture; sorting out rent and bills; managing money and claiming benefits; insurance and security; being a good tenant; </li>
				<li title="*">
<strong>make the most of your neighbourhood: </strong>finding shops and services; looking for jobs, training or courses; making use of leisure time; 
				</li>
				<li title="*">					<strong>get in touch with extra help: </strong> talking about problems; getting expert advice on things like debt, mental health, drugs or alcohol; contacting social services or other organisations </li>
				</ul><h2>What do you get? </h2><p>You'll get your own support worker who'll talk through any problems with you. They'll agree a 'support plan' that tells you what to expect and how often they'll visit. </p><p>Our aim is to help you get on your feet and live independently - so, after a time, you won't need us any more! But you can always come back if you need help in the future. </p><h2>Interested? </h2><p>
