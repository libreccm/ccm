When you report a repair you will be advised of that period.</p><p>If the repair has not been done at the end of that period we would ask you to contact us and we will pursue the matter with the contractor.</p><p>The Council has considered whether or not to make discretionary allowances to tenants who have had repairs become overdue. However, the payment would actually have to come from the very rent that tenants pay and it would seem to be counterproductive to have to increase the Council rents in order to compensate tenants for overdue repairs.</p><p>It is our intent to carry out repairs as effectively as possible, but it is not always possible to do them within the intended timespan. This may be because of the sickness of a tradesman or it may simply be that the parts required for the repair are not available. It is important that should you feel dissatisfied with the repairs service you should contact us to discuss the matter as we would much rather you do that than ignore the problem.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
