It is not possible to offer this service to all our elderly tenants so to qualify tenants must meet the following criteria:-</i></p><hr/><li title="*">Over 60 years of age and/or disabled.</li><li title="*">Physically unable to do the work themselves.</li><li title="*">No other person living with you or within reasonable distance able to help maintain your garden.</li><p>The garden maintenance covers the cutting of grass and any hedges but does not include the maintenance of bushes, shrub beds and trees. In addition, extra work is often required to a garden before it is added to the list. If necessary, this work will also be carried out as a 'one off' only, prior to the maintenance outlined above.</p><p>The garden maintenance is carried out by a contractor appointed by the Council who will have appropriate identification. It is important that you ask to see this before allowing any workmen into your property.</p><p>The Housing Department has a fixed budget every year in order to carry out this work and it may not always be possible to include everyone who applies on the current list. A Waiting List is therefore held in date order of registration.</p><p>If you feel that you meet the criteria for garden maintenance, then please contact us using the details above.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
