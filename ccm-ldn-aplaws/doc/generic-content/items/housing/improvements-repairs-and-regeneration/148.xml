This is to eliminate discrepancies that have occurred 
  across the country.</p><p>The actual level of the rents is determined by how much the Council needs to spend on services to its tenants.</p><p>Rent is paid into what is termed 'The Housing Revenue Account' and this, along with small amounts of Government subsidy, is what pays for the services that tenants receive. It also covers other items such as paying the cost of borrowing for the original build of that property and for capital improvements. The rent that Council tenants pay does not contribute to other services that the Council provides, nor is it subsidised by the Council Tax payments.</p><p>Each year the Council considers carefully how much money it will need to raise the following year from rents and subsidies in order to carry out its programmes of repair and maintenance.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
