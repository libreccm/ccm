Where such markets were held, people travelled from miles around to buy and sell the essentials of everyday life. </i></p><hr/><p>A day at the market was just that! The journey to market took 1/3rd of the day, trading required another 1/3rd and the weary journey home used up the remaining 1/3rd of the day. A man was deemed to be able to travel 20 miles in a day and thus it was determined that markets must be at least 6 and 2/3rds miles apart. This calculation 
  is still used today as the basis for the protection of market rights.</p><p>Towns grew up around the site of regular markets, which were usually held on one or two days each week, or on special feasts and festivals. Many of today's thriving communities owe their existence to the market in their midst.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
