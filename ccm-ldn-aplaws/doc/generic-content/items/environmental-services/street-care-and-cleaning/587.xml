</p><p>The flytipping of controlled 
  waste is a serious criminal offence which carries a fine of up to &#xA3;20,000 
  (unlimited if indicted to the Crown Court) or an offender can even be sent to 
  prison. It is important to realise that it is also an offence to permit flytipping.</p><p>Flytipping is often associated 
  with dumping waste from vehicles. In this case the person controlling the use 
  of the vehicle can also be prosecuted, which means that it is possible for a 
  prosecution to occur when only the vehicle, not the driver, is identifiable.</p><p>The Police also have the 
  powers to seize vehicles used for flytipping.</p><h2>If you discover flytipped 
  waste after the tippers have left, please follow these simple Do's
  and Dont's:</h2><ul>
<li title="*">
<strong>Do not touch the waste</strong>: flytipped waste can be dangerous - it may contain syringes, 
  broken glass, asbestos, toxic chemicals or other hazardous substances.</li>
  <li title="*">
<strong>Visually inspect the waste</strong>: try to determine what the waste consists of and how much 
  there is.</li>
  <li title="*">
<strong>Take note of its exact location</strong>: and also, whether it is in or near water.</li>
  <li title="*">
<strong>Do not disturb the site</strong>: there may be evidence that could help identify the culprits and 
  lead to their prosecution.</li>
</ul><h2>If You See Someone Flytipping: </h2><p>If possible, please make 
  a note of:</p><ul>
<li title="*">The 
      day, date and time you saw the tipping. </li>
  </ul><p> What you saw:</p><ul>
<li title="*">How 
      many people were flytipping and what they looked like</li>
      <li title="*">What 
      they were actually doing</li>
      <li title="*">Any 
      vehicles involved - their make, colour and registration number</li>
</ul><p> Where were you when you 
  saw the flytipping:</p><ul>
<li title="*">What 
      kind of view you had</li>
      <li title="*">How 
      far away you were</li>
      <li title="*">Weather 
      and light conditions</li>
</ul><p> What was tipped:</p><ul>
<li title="*">How 
      much?</li>
