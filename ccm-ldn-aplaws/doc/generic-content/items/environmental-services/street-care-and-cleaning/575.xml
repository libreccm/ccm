				Dogs
			</h2><p>
			<span class="gen">enter council name</span> (&quot;The Council&quot;) has a duty under the 
  Environmental Protection Act 1990 section 149 to collect and detain stray dogs. 
  
			</p><p>
				The Council also has the 
  power to dispose of the dogs if they remain unclaimed. 
			</p><p>
				When dealing with stray 
  dogs we will take into account the relevant provisions of:
			</p><ul>
			<li title="*">The Dangerous Dogs 
      Act 1991 </li>
			<li title="*">The Dogs (Fouling of 
      Land) Act 1996</li>
			<li title="*">The Control of Dogs 
      Order 1992</li>
			<li title="*">The Protection of Animals 
      Act 1911</li>
			<li title="*">The Abandonment of 
      Animals Act 1960</li>
			<li title="*">Any other relevant 
      legislation</li>
		</ul><p>
				 The Environmental Protection 
  Act 1990 Sec 150 requires the finder of of a stray dog to: 
			</p><ul>
			<li title="*">Return 
      the dog to its owner; or</li>
			<li title="*">contact the local authority 
      for the area in which the dog was found; or</li>
			<li title="*">take the dog to the 
      police station nearest to where the dog was found. </li>
		</ul><p>
				 If the finder fails to 
  take one of these courses of action, he will have commited an offence and would 
  be liable, upon conviction, to a fine. 
			</p><p>
				If the finder requests to 
  keep the dog, he must supply the officer with his contact details and details 
  of the dog. The officer is required to keep a record of these details. 
			</p><p>
				Regulations require that 
  the officer makes appropriate enquiries to ascertain that the finder is a suitable 
  person to keep the dog. 
			</p><p>
				The finder must then be 
  informed verbally and in writing that he is obliged to keep the dog (if unclaimed 
  by the owner) for not less than one month and that failure to comply with that 
  obligation is a criminal offence. 
			</p><h2>
				Other Animals
			</h2><p>
				 Under the Animal Act 1971 
  the Council can impound any livestock which has strayed onto Council land. 
  
			</p><p>
				The animals are only returned 
  to their owners after payment for any damages and expenses incurred. 
			</p><p>
				Livestock that has strayed 
  onto private land may also be impounded, at the written request of the landowner. 
  
			</p><p>
				If known, the owner of 
  the animal will be informed that the animal has strayed onto Council land, and 
  giving details of where it can be collected within 
						<span class="gen">enter amount</span> days, subject to the payment for any damage caused, and 
  expense incurred.
			</p><p>
				We will notify the police 
  of the straying animal and inform them that we intend to impound it.
			</p><p>
				After <span class="gen">enter amount</span> days, we will arrange for the animal to be impounded and 
  removed to a suitable establishment where it will be held for a minimum of <span class="gen">enter amount</span>
					days.
			</p><p>
				The animal will be returned, 
  on satisfactory proof of ownership and the payment for any damage caused, and 
  expense incurred.
			</p><p>
				If any animal has not been 
  claimed after <span class="gen">enter amount</span> days, 
  it will be sold. If the owner appears after this time and produces satisfactory 
  proof of ownership, any monies received will be given to the owner less the 
  cost of any damage caused, and expense incurred.
