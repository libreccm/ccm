Much of this is left on footpaths and playing fields and at best can cover shoes and clothes and at worst can lead to blindness due to an infection called 'Toxocara canis'.</i></p><hr/><p>Council's can now designate 
  land under The Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996. The designated land includes 
  roads, footpaths, school playing fields, sports fields and parks. It is an offence 
  for a dog owner not to clean up after their dog in these areas. Failure to comply 
  can result in a prosecution and fine up to &#xA3;1000. It is no defence to 
  claim ignorance of the dog's actions.</p><h2>Solutions:</h2><ul>
			<li title="*">If you 
      have a garden encourage the dog to 'go' there. You can then bury the mess 
      or alternatively clean it up and bin it.</li>
			<li title="*">If you 
      walk your dog always carry the means to clear up after your dog. A simple 
      plastic bag will do the trick or obtain poop scoops from a local pet shop. 
      Remember to take a bag or poop scoop like you'd remember a lead.</li>
			<li title="*">Every time 
      your dog fouls &quot;bag it and bin it&quot;. Take the poop scoop home and dispose 
      of it there. Remember Rain does not wash the problem away.</li>
			<li title="*">Never let 
      your dog out alone to &quot;go to the loo&quot;.</li>
		</ul><p>It is every 
      dog owners duty to clean up after their dog. </p><p>
			<strong>There are no excuses, fouling is unacceptable!</strong>
