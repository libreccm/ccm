Over 120 nations signed up to Agenda 21, an agenda for sustainable development. Sustainable development considers the impact on our future, of the balance between environmental, economic and social issues of today's activities, policies and new developments. The Agenda 21 agreement covers a wide range of issues and gives responsibilities to different groups. This includes an obligation for local councils all over the world to draw up and implement Local Agenda 21 plans. Part of this Local Agenda 21 process is concerned with engaging the local community and raising awareness of issues relating to sustainability such as energy efficiency, recycling, transport and water and environmental conservation. </p><h2>What Agenda 21 covers </h2><p>Internationally, the Agenda 21 plan included a very wide range of subjects.
