  <li title="*">Always contact the Local Authority to ensure that the trees are not protected by a Tree Protection Order, planning constraints or that the tree is within a Conservation area. </li>
  <li title="*">Always employ a suitable trained professional Tree Surgeon, who is covered by Public Liability Insurance. (Always ask for proof). </li>
  <li title="*">
<strong>Never </strong> employ house callers or leaflet droppers claiming to be professional tree surgeons. </li>
  <li title="*">Reputable Tree Surgeons will always have some form of professional identification and qualification proof. <strong>Always </strong>ask to see it. </li>
  <li title="*">Reputable Tree Surgeons can be found in the Yellow Pages or contact us for further advice. </li>
