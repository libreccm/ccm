  is to improve the perception of our town centres.</i></p><hr/><p>To qualify for a shop front grant, the following must apply to you:</p><li title="*">You are an independent trader with no more than 6 properties in total.</li><li title="*">The property itself is within the defined area called <span class="gen">enter name</span>.
				</li><li title="*">You are prepared to return your property to its former glory by using natural 
    products of the period and to jointly agree a scheme with the Council.</li><li title="*">You are either the Landlord or you have the Landlord's permission in writing 
    to carry out work.</li><p>
				The grant you receive varies depending on the size of the project and 
  the costs involved, but as a general guide grants are based on  <span class="gen">enter amount</span>per shop front, up to a maximum of 50% of the cost.
			</p><p>
				Projects vary enormously from a simple re-paint and 
  signage package to a complete renovation.
			</p><p>Use the contact details at the top of this page to apply for a grant.  
  We will arrange for sketch/final drawings to be produced, arrange for planning consent 
  which you must pay for and we will put the project out to tender.
