The primary purpose of this type of legislation is to ensure 'truthfulness of trade' thus preventing consumers being misled during contractual negotiations for goods and services.</i></p><hr/><h2>Trade Descriptions Act 1968</h2><p>The Act ensures that descriptions applied to goods and services are accurate and has been used successfully to combat common problems such as car 'clocking' and product counterfeiting. Its scope is very wide and also covers descriptions applied in all areas of trade.</p><h2>Property Misdescriptions Act 1991</h2><p>This Act is designed to regulate those persons in the course of estate agency or property development business who falsely describe or make misleading statements in relation to land. This includes amongst other things descriptions in relation the address and location of a property, room sizes, easements and maintenance charges.</p><h2>Consumer Credit Act 1974</h2><p>This Act is designed to regulate those businesses or individuals who offer credit facilities to consumers so that there is 'truth in lending' and covers areas such as advertising, loans, mortgages and other credit transactions.</p><p>We aim to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li title="*">Credit is fairly provided</li>
<li title="*">Goods, services and 
      property are not misdescribed</li>
<li title="*">Holidays and timeshare 
      accommodation are not misrepresented</li>
<li title="*">Prices are correctly 
      displayed and do not mislead</li>
<li title="*">Traders do not sell 
      counterfeit goods</li>
<li title="*">Steps are taken to 
      end unfair trading practices</li>
