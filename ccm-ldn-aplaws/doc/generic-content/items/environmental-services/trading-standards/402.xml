  the Consumer Protection Act 1987, and the General Product Safety Regulations 
  1994, there has been an increase in the provision for safety of consumer goods. 
  The Trading Standards service has an important role in supporting and advising 
  businesses, as well as cracking down on unsafe products and unscrupulous traders. 
  </p><p>There has been a number 
  of regulations made under the Consumer Protection Act to legislate on particular 
  types of goods such as:</p><ul>
<li title="*">The Furniture and Furnishings 
      (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988.</li>
      <li title="*">The Toys (Safety) Regulations 
      1995 Implementing Council Directive 88/378/EEC. </li>
      <li title="*">The Electrical Equipment 
      (Safety) Regulations 1994.</li>
      <li title="*">The Plugs and Sockets 
      Etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994.</li>
      <li title="*">The Gas Appliances 
      (Safety) Regulations 1995.</li>
      <li title="*">The Bunk Beds (Entrapment 
      Hazard) (Safety) Regulations 1987.</li>
      <li title="*">The Cosmetic Product 
      (Safety) Regulations 1989. </li>
</ul><p>and 
many more.</p><h2>European Legislation</h2><p> The increase in European 
  directives being enacted by UK regulations, for example Electromagnetic Compatibility 
  Regulations 1992, has also meant a wider role for Trading Standards Officers, 
  and an important role also in supporting and advising businesses, as well as 
  cracking down on unsafe products and unscrupulous traders.</p><p>UK Regulations which implement 
  EU 100A directives are becoming an important area of trading standards responsibility. 
  The Regulations deal with a very wide and varied range of products and attempt 
  to reduce the barriers to trade through 'Essential Safety Requirements'.</p><p>Some examples of the regulations 
  already implemented:</p><ul>
<li title="*">Medical Devices Regulations 
      1994. </li>
      <li title="*">Electromagnetic Compatibility 
      Regulations 1992.</li>
      <li title="*">Personal Protective 
      Equipment Regulations 1992. </li>
      <li title="*">Supply of Machinery 
      Regulations 1992. </li>
      <li title="*">Simple Pressure Vessels 
      Regulations 1991.</li>
