these pests within 5 working days at no charge to households and for a fee at non 
residential locations.</i></p><hr/><p>Other pests causing concern are Wasps, Ants and various insects. These are dealt with for a fee. Costs are specified below.</p><p>Pest Control services can be arranged by telephoning during normal working hours, where our staff will provide advice and make an appointment for treatment if you wish. Alternatively you can contact us by email.</p><p>Officers call by prior appointment and apply safe and effective treatments. If for any reason the problem persists they will return and make every effort to ensure the pest is eradicated.</p><p>Charges from <span class="gen">enter date</span> for 12 months</p><table width="90%" cellpadding="5" class="centre" summary="Charges for Pest Control Service">
