			What is the Scheme about?</h3><p>
			<span class="gen">enter council name</span> has operated a Local Voluntary Dog Registration scheme since enter date.</p><p>A computerised recording system of tag numbers will give instant information as to the dog's name as well as the address and telephone number of owners.</p><h3>
			
			How much does it cost?</h3><p>For an annual fee of &#xA3; <span class="gen">enter amount</span>, a personal number ID tag will be issued and will remain valid for a period of 12 months from the date of registration.</p><h3>
			
			What happens if my dog is lost?</h3><p>Lost or stray dogs will be returned to the owner if picked up by one of the Dog Wardens in the area. This will apply during normal working hours, Monday to Friday, providing the dog has a valid collar and disc.</p><p>All reasonable steps will be taken to contact the owner should they not be at home when calling. If contact is not made, the dog will be taken to the nearest available kennelling facility for safe keeping for a period of 24 hours.</p><p>The dog will not be impounded (unless picked up more than 2 times in any one year) thereby saving the owner the cost of the pound fee, currently <span class="gen">enter amount.</span>
