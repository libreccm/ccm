  Their duties and responsibilities are now governed in the main by the Coroners
  Act 1988. It is important that a Coroner, either himself or through a Deputy,
  should be ready to undertake his duties at all times. A Coroner is assisted
  by his Officers, who may be civilians or police officers.</i></p><hr/><p> The main duty of a Coroner is to enquire into sudden or unexplained deaths
  usually by having a post-mortem examination made, followed by an inquest if
  the cause of death is not natural. In addition to this there are specific requirements
  to investigate deaths in certain circumstances, for example, the death of a
  person in custody, or a death resulting from a person's occupation. </p><p> Coroners are appointed by the Council on a part-time basis. Their
  work involves the holding of inquests, arranging for post mortems to be carried
  out and employing any other services, such as Funeral Directors, as may be
  necessary. Coroners are required by law to be qualified as a Barrister, Solicitor
  or legally qualified Medical Practitioner of not less than five years standing.
  The Coroners are appointed by the Director of Property, Business and Regulatory
  Services.</p><p>Please visit
