  dust, steam and smell. The emissions must arise from premises and must materially 
  affect the use of enjoyment or other premises. </p><p>Typical of complaints of this type are smoke and ash from garden bonfires, smoking 
  chimneys, dust from building and demolition activity and cooking smells from restaurants. 
  The legislation does not allow us to deal with complaints of smells arising from 
  domestic premises.</p><p>If satisfied that a complaint of statutory nuisance is justified, an Abatement/Penalty 
  Notice will be served upon the person responsible, occupier or owner of the premises 
  (as appropriate) requiring that the nuisance be abated. Failure to comply with an 
  Abatement/Penalty Notice is an offence and legal proceedings may result. If found 
  guilty of an offence of this type then the maximum fine is &#xA3; <span class="gen">enter amount</span> on domestic 
  premises and &#xA3; <span class="gen">enter amount</span> o commercial premises.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
