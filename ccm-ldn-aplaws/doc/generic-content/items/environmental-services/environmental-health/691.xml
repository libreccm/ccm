	          which control smoke emissions and the height of chimneys and those relating
        to the content and composition of motor fuels.</i></p><hr/><p>The control of chimney heights enables local authorities to take into account
    a number of relevant factors in determining the height of a chimney.</p><p>Under section 14 of the Act, unless the height of the chimney has been
	    approved by the local authority and any conditions attached to approval
	    adhered to, it is an offence to cause to cause or knowingly permit a furnace
	    to be used to:</p><ul>
			<li title="*">burn pulverised fuel</li>
			<li title="*">burn at a rate of 45.4 kg or more an hour any other solid matter or</li>
			<li title="*"> burn at a rate equivalent to 366.4 kW or more any liquid or gaseous matter</li>
			</ul><p>An application for chimney height approval must contain adequate information
	    to enable the necessary calculations to be carried out.</p><p>The local authority must consider an application for approval for chimney
	    height for a furnace and give a written decision within 28 days of receipt,
	    unless it is agreed in writing between us and the applicant that a longer
	    period is allowed. If we fail to deal with the application within this time
	    period, then approval without qualification is given.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
