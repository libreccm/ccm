			How do I know if it is my drain that is blocked?</h3><p>If your drain is blocked you will usually know because your waste will stop going away when you flush the toilet, or gullies outside will overflow. There will also probably be a smell. Private drains/sewers are the responsibility of the owner-occupier and any other properties connected to it. The Council can arrange for clearance of a blocked drain.</p><h3>
