<strong>Private Water Supplies:</strong> For those who extract their private water supply

<strong>Mains Water: </strong>To include Manufacturers of foods and drinks as well as occasionally 
  looking at domestic supply.</p><h3>Details</h3><h4>Private Water Supplies</h4><p>We have a number of domestic and commercial private water supplies where we are the responsible authority for monitoring their quality both microbiologically 
  (bacteria) and chemically (e.g. pesticides).</p><p>The legislation we use is made under the Water Industry Act 1991 and is called 
  the Private Water Supplies Regulations 1991.</p><p>This tells us what the standards of the water should be and how often we have to 
  test the water depending upon its use.</p><h4>Bathing Waters</h4><p>We are responsible for checking the quality of all our swimming pools to include leisure centres, private health clubs, hotels and out door pools, hospital hydrotherapy pools, Jacuzzi's and paddling pools.</p><p>We check these on a monthly basis for chemical levels as well as yearly for microbiological 
  quality (bacteria) unless there is a complaint or a problem with the chemical tests, 
  in which case the frequency will be increased.</p><h4>Mains Water Supply</h4><p>We also examine the quality of the mains water in our food manufacturers to include 
  breweries and other food industries. We may occasionally become involved in the 
  testing of domestic mains water in addition to the statutory water undertaker.</p><p>In addition, the <strong>
