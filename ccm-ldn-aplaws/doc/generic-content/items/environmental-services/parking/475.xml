				<li title="*">a hazard to pedestrians causing an obstruction which may result in them having to step off the pavement onto the highway thus putting themselves in danger.</li>
				<li title="*">a hazard by restricting the width of the pavement making it difficult for someone with a pushchair of wheelchair to pass safely - again this person may have to step into the highway to avoid the obstruction.</li>
				<li title="*">a hazard due to the damage caused by driving on and off the pavement - broken flags etc.</li>
