  sites for everyone to enjoy. The Rangers carry out practical conservation work and 
  environmental education in addition to organising events and activities.</i></p><hr/><p>The Rangers regularly patrol all of our Countryside sites. These 
  patrols help them to monitor any maintenance problems and promote an effective and 
  efficient response to issues.</p><p>The presence of Rangers in their familiar and distinctive uniform 
  can be a very reassuring sight for visitors to the countryside. Knowing that there 
  is someone there to answer your questions, or help to solve any problems encourages 
  visitors to venture out and visit sites they are not familiar with. </p><p>Patrolling also gives the Rangers the opportunity to keep a 
  protective eye on our local wildlife. Being aware of what is present and where it 
  is located helps us to protect it.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
