  origins of litter is extremely difficult and research is underway by various 
  organisations to tackle the issue of dumping at sea. </p><p>It is illegal to dispose 
  of garbage, plastic, waste oil, sewage or any toxic substance at sea.</p><p>The following 
  guidelines can help avoid many problems:</p><h2>Don't...</h2><ul>
<li title="*">Dump garbage 
      or plastics at sea</li>
<li title="*">Dump damaged fishing 
      gear at sea</li>
<li title="*">Dump oil at sea</li>
<li title="*">Dump sewage at sea</li>
<li title="*">Dump toxic substances 
      at sea</li>
<li title="*">Use detergents or hoses 
      to deal with spill</li>
</ul><h2>Do...</h2><p>
<strong>Garbage 
  and Plastics</strong>
</p><ul>
  <li title="*">Remove 
      excess packaging before leaving home</li>
<li title="*">Arrange sufficient 
      and secure storage on board for wastes</li>
<li title="*">Rinse tins and plastic 
      containers to avoid them becoming smelly</li>
<li title="*">Separate wastes for 
      recycling ashore</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Sewage</strong>
</p><ul>
<li title="*">&gt;Fit a sewage 
      holding tank in your boat</li>
<li title="*">Use shore side facilities 
      whenever possible</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Antifouling</strong> 
</p><ul>
<li title="*">When cleaning 
      down hulls, use a scrub-off facility that collects run-off residues thus 
      presenting toxic dust or scrapings entering the sea</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Oils 
  and Oily Wastes</strong>
</p><ul>
  <li title="*">Use absorbent 
      pads to soak up oil in bilges and place a drip tray under the engine</li>
<li title="*">Take waste oil ashore 
      in secure containers for safe disposal into shore side facilities</li>
<li title="*">Avoid spillage into 
      the sea when refuelling, do not overfill your tank</li>
<li title="*">When servicing the 
      engine, ensure that used oil is collected and taken to an oil recycling 
      bank</li>
<li title="*">Remember used oil is 
      very difficult to recycle when mixed with other materials, such as paints 
      and solvents</li>
</ul><p>The benefits of appropriate 
  facilities on land far outweigh the negative impact to marine life, the environment 
  and human health from dumping at sea - together with incurred costs from damage 
  to boats and equipment from marine debris.</p><p>The MARPOL Convention is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes. It is a combination of two treaties adopted in 1973 and 1978 respectively and updated by amendments through the years.  Further information can be obtained from the
