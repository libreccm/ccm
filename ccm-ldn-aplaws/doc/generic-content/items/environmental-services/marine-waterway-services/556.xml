Time moves on and, sadly, commercial boats and barges have all but disappeared, but the waterways still retain their charm and character. </i></p><hr/><p>
Because of their age, the canals are abound with interesting structures. In fact you will find more listed buildings on the canals than anywhere else in Britain.

</a>	, <span class="gen">link to external website</span> who look after the canals in this country, are very conscious of looking after their heritage and the improvements are all built so that they do not clash with the older environment. </p><p>Most canals have towpaths that were used by the horses which pulled the boats. They are very pleasant to walk and are teaming with wild flowers and animals, but remember that ducks and swans expect to be fed ! You can also take bikes with you to use the towpaths and local bye-ways to explore the countryside around the canals. </p><p>Other useful websites can be found at:</p><ul>
