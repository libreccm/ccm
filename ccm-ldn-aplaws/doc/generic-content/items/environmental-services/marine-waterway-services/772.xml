        The importation of pets (including hamsters, gerbils, mice and birds) 
        into the UK is strictly controlled and it is essential that anyone intending 
        to import a pet should obtain the latest information. The Rabies (Importation 
        of Dogs, Cats and Other Animals) Order 1974, as amended, gives powers 
        to destroy animals landed without a pet passport. In addition the Act 
        has powers to fine or imprison owners of animals so it is important that 
        the requirements are met. </p><p> Information 
  can be obtained from the <strong>
