With regard to vetting and checking to ascertain whether the organisation applying is genuine or not, the same procedures apply as for street collections. </p><p>  As with street collection permits there is a requirement for the promoter of the collection to make a return following the collection. </p><p>  Collections generally take place from door to door or from one public house to another. </p><p>  Some of the larger well-known charities such as Christian Aid, Help the Aged etc, have a Charity Commission exemption from having to apply for a permit, but by and large most of the smaller, and particularly local groups and organisations need a permit before they can collect money (or articles which they intend to sell later), from door to door. </p><p>  Unlike street collections, there is a statutory right of appeal against the refusal to grant a house to house collection permit. In this case, the right of appeal is to the Secretary of State, and the grounds for refusal are set out in the Act itself. </p><p>  One of the key grounds for refusal would be where the total amount likely to be applied for charitable purpose as a result of the collection, is inadequate in proportion to the value of the proceeds likely to be received. So, for instance, where an applicant intends to claim a fair proportion of the proceeds of the collection for expenses, a permit could be refused.There is no statutory guidance to local authorities on what would be a reasonable amount for expenses. </p><p>A copy of the House to House Collections Act 1939 can be viewed at the Council Offices where you can also obtain an application form and a copy of our standard conditions. </p><p>Alternatively, <strong>
