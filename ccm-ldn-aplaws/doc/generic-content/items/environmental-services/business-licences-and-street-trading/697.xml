When this vapour is mixed with air in proportions between 1% and 8% a risk of fire or explosion exists. Petrol vapour is heavier than air and does not disperse easily in still conditions. It tends to sink to the lowest possible level of its surroundings and may accumulate in tanks, cavities, drains, pits or other depressions. </i></p><hr/><p>Flammable 
  atmospheres may also exist where clothing or other absorbent material or substances 
  are contaminated with petrol.Petrol vapour can have acute or chronic effects 
  if inhaled and therefore should be considered in the assessment required under 
  the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999 (COSHH). </p><p> The petroleum licensing 
  authority is <span class="gen">enter name of council</span> (Trading 
  Standards) who are responsible for ensuring safety at sites where 
  petrol is delivered, stored and dispensed. </p><p> The keeping of petrol must 
  be in accordance with conditions attached to a licence issued under the Petroleum 
  (Consolidation) Act 1928. When an Inspector appointed by the licensing authority 
  visits a petrol filling station the aim is to ensure the observance, maintenance 
  and, where necessary, the improvement of safety standards. </p><p> Other safety-related legislation 
  is enforced by the local councils or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), dependent on the main activity 
  at the premises concerned. </p><p> At the time of writing 
  there are proposals being considered for changes to petrol legislation. These 
  may affect licensing and health and safety enforcement responsibilities. Contact 
  your enforcing authority for the current position. </p><h2>Petroleum Licensing - Petrol Filling 
  Stations</h2><p>The petroleum licensing 
  authority contact address is:</p><p>

</p><p> Safety aspects of petroleum 
  delivery, storage and dispensing are the responsibility of the licensing authority. Council Officers work to, and are able to give advice on, nationally produced guidance 
  such as: </p><p>HS(G) 146 - Dispensing petrol. 
  Assessing and controlling the risk of fire and explosion at sites where petrol 
  is stored and dispensed as a fuel. </p><h2>Other Health and Safety Considerations 
  </h2><p>In addition to the general 
  duties established under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (s.2, 3, 
  4, 7 and 8) the following legislation may also be of relevance in premises 
  visited by local authority health and safety inspectors: </p><li title="*">Management of Health 
      and Safety at Work Regulations 1999. (Risk assessment, appointment of competent 
      persons etc)</li><li title="*">COSHH 1999 (assessment 
      and control of risks arising from substances hazardous to health).</li><li title="*">Reporting of Injuries, 
      Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR)(iv) Electricity 
      at Work Regulations 1989(v) Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 
      1998.</li><h2>Petrol and COSHH 1999 </h2><p> Aspiration is the entry 
  of liquid into the lungs following swallowing and subsequent vomiting. Petrol 
  is classified as 'Harmful by ingestion' owing to this aspiration hazard i.e. 
  the risk of chemical pneumonitis, and not because of its acute toxicity i.e. 
  poisoning, properties. Petrol is also classified as a skin irritant, due to 
  its potential to cause dermatitis. The presence of up to 5% benzene means that 
  petrol is classified as Carcinogenic, Category 2 (See element on 'Carcinogens' 
  in this manual for further guidance). </p><p> Under COSHH 1999 a suitable 
  and sufficient risk assessment is required for all jobs carried out involving 
  petrol. This may involve emergency procedures (spillages or accidental ingestion), 
  protective clothing to prevent skin contact and precautions to control exposure 
  by inhalation. </p><h2>Petrol - General Safety</h2><p> Where petrol might be used 
  (eg. mobile equipment, generators) or workers exposed to other petrol fire/explosion 
  risks (eg. garage workshops) an assessment needs to be carried out on the risks 
  involved to ensure that adequate control measures are taken. Leaflets giving 
  advice on petrol safety are available, covering safe storage, carriage and use. </p><p>  When draining petrol tanks, appropriate advice includes: </p><ul>
<li title="*">Choose a level, well-ventilated 
      area, preferably out of doors. </li>
      <li title="*">Never drain petrol 
      over a pit.</li>
      <li title="*">Keep all sources of 
      ignition well away. </li>
      <li title="*">Use a proper fuel retriever 
      or syphon</li>
      <li title="*">If draining into a 
      container, use a funnel</li>
      <li title="*">Do not attempt hot 
      work on petrol tanks </li>
</ul><h2> Checklist - Petrol and Petrol Filling 
  Stations</h2><li title="*">Have you 
      carried out a COSHH assessment regarding exposure to petrol?</li><li title="*">As a premises storing/dispensing 
      petrol as a fuel do you comply with the licence issued by your Petroleum
