Music has to be a substantial ingredient and there are specific exemptions for music which is incidental to to functions such as garden fetes, bazaars and sporting events. Music performed in a place of religious worship or as part of a religious meeting is also exempt. </p><p>Private music and dance events such as weddings or birthday parties do not require a Public Entertainments Licence. </p><p>Premises, for example pubs and bars, which hold a drinks licence granted by the Magistrates Court, can play recorded music <strong>or</strong> have up to two live performers, providing music and singing only, without needing a Public Entertainments Licence. If there is a combination of recorded music and live performers, for example karaoke, then a licence will be required. </p><p>All premises are inspected by the Fire Service, the Council's Building Surveyor and an Environmental Health Officer. There is also a statutory duty to consult with the Police. </p><p>Most premises will hold a full licence which is renewable every year, however for premises that hold &quot;one-off&quot; events an occasional licence can be granted. </p><p>Not less than 28 days notice is required for applications for Public Entertainments Licences. </p><p>Copies of the  Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 can be purchased from Her Majesty's Stationery Office.
</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be viewed at the Council Offices where you can also obtain an application form and a copy of our standard conditions. </p><p>Alternatively, <strong>
