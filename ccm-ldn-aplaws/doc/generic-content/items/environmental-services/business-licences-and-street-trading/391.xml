Any time restriction cannot be earlier than 11pm. </p><p>  All Late Night Refreshment House Licences expire on <span class="gen">enter date</span> in each year and they are not transferable to another person. This means that if the person running the premises changes, a new licence has to be applied for. </p><p>  Prior to a licence being granted, the Police, the Planning Department and the local Environmental Health Officer are consulted.
