Where the machine in question pays out a combination of cash, gifts and/or tokens, the maximum payout permissible is &#xA3;5.00 in cash or &#xA3;8.00 in cash and/or tokens. There are no age restrictions in force for such machines and so children can also play them. Where the machine in question pays out cash only, the maximum payout permissible is &#xA3;15.00.
