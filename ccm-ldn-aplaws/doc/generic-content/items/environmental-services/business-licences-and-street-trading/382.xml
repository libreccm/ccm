When it is necessary to place hoardings on the highway around the place of work or scaffolding, permission is necessary and can be obtained from the Council, on completion of a form together with a sketch.  Once permission has been granted, the conditions attached to the licence must be carefully read and kept to at all times.  The basic requirements of the conditions are as follows: </p><h2>
			<strong>Hoardings: </strong>
		</h2><ul>
			<li title="*">To be a minimum of 2.5m high and to be able to withstand high winds. </li>
			<li title="*">Illumination may be required if street lighting is not adequate. </li>
			<li title="*">Must have a smooth finish with no protruding parts. </li>
			<li title="*">Pedestrian walkways of satisfactory width are to be maintained or provided and regularly inspected by the Contractor. </li>
		</ul><h2>
			<strong>Scaffolding: </strong>
		</h2><ul>
			<li title="*">During the erection or dismantling period, a safe working area at ground level is required to be provided to prevent pedestrians gaining access - this means that in the Town Centre, this work is to be carried out outside normal working hours, i.e. after 6.00pm or before 8.00am on a Sunday. </li>
			<li title="*">Will require illumination unless no part of it is less than 0.45m (18 inches) from a carriageway in a horizontal direction and no part of it over a footway is less than 2.4m 
    (8 feet) above the footway. </li>
			<li title="*">Pedestrian walkway to be maintained around the scaffold.  If this cannot be arranged, it requires to be designed to allow access under and through the scaffold safely - no trip hazards, no projecting tubes or fittings, covered adequately to provide a working platform and prevent materials or debris falling through.  Poles to be highlighted.  A reasonable free walking width must be maintained to enable persons in wheelchairs/prams, etc, to pass the scaffold safely. </li>
		</ul><p>The Council has the necessary powers to issue licences for scaffolding; to require erection of hoardings to separate building works from the street; and to ensure hoardings are securely erected.  Contravention of these is an offence with maximum fines of &#xA3;5,000 (non-compliance with scaffolding licence), &#xA3;1,000 plus &#xA3;2 per day (contravention of Section 172 of the Act) and &#xA3;200 plus &#xA3;1 per day (contravention of Section 173 of the Act). </p><p> Copies of the Highways Act 1980  can be purchased from Her Majesty's Stationery Office. </p><p>A copy of the Highways Act 1980 can be inspected at the Council Offices, where you may also obtain an application form and further help or advice. </p><p>Alternatively, you can
