The Act does not just apply to cinema premises but also includes exhibitions produced by video equipment such as video juke boxes in pubs and video screens in nightclubs. </i></p><hr/><p>  Prior to licensing, premises are inspected by the Fire Service, the Council's Building Surveyor and an Environmental Health Officer. The Police are also consulted. </p><p>  Films can normally only be shown if the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has awarded a certificate. These range from &quot;U&quot; which means universal and can be seen by anyone, to &quot;18&quot; which means that only persons who are 18 and over can be admitted to see a particular film. </p><p>  The Council has the power to act as a local censor and give permission for a film to be shown which has not been granted a certificate by the BBFC. The Council also has powers to prohibit the exhibition of a film even though a certificate has been granted,or alter the BBFC certification from, for example a &quot;PG&quot; to a &quot;12&quot;. </p><p>Copies of the  Cinemas Act 1985 can be purchased from Her Majesty's Stationery Office.</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be viewed at the Council Offices where you can also obtain an application form and a copy of our standard conditions. </p><p>Alternatively, <strong>
