For such sites a trader's licence must be obtained from the appropriate Council.</i></p><hr/><p>The erection of signs or stalls for the sale of produce within the highway, including 
  grass verges, is illegal. However, produce can be sold from the land on which it 
  is grown, but signs advertising such facilities must be clear of the highway and 
  may require Planning Permission. Any unlicensed use of the highway for tables and 
  chairs is an obstruction and may be dealt with by the police.</p><p>There are three main types of permission which may have to be obtained before tables 
  and chairs may be placed on a part of the highway:</p><p>Planning Permission and Listed Building Consent may be required from the Council for the use of the land or building for a cafe. There is a fee for this 
  and planning approval must have been granted before an application will be considered 
  by the Council.</p><p> A licence will be required, from the Council as the Highway Authority, 
  to put tables and chairs out on a public highway, whether it be on the street or 
  a pavement or a pedestrian area. There is a fee for this, payable before a licence 
  can be issued.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
