The supplier is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate regulations are adhered to. </p><p>
			<strong>Note: </strong> It is not the householder or the builders' (contractor) responsibility to obtain the highway permit. </p><p>If you wish to place a builder's skip on any part of the highway a licence is required from this Authority. </p><p>A licence can be valid for any period between 1 day and 28 days. For longer periods additional applications should be made. Only one skip will be allowed on site at any one time except in exceptional circumstances. </p><p>Whenever possible, skips should be placed on the carriageway. If permission is granted to place skips on a footway or grass verge, a  deposit of <span class="gen">enter amount</span> is payable to cover any damage which may be caused. </p><p>Skips placed on the carriageway require at least 4 traffic cones on the approach side to guide traffic past the skip. </p><p>During the hours of darkness, in poor daytime visibility and bad weather, road danger lamps (flashing amber) must be placed against or attached to each corner of the skip. If sited on the carriageway, a lamp should be placed between each cone. </p><p>If this authority's contractors are called out to lamp a skip or make it safe, a charge will follow. </p><p>Skips placed on the highway shall <strong>not </strong> contain any inflammable, explosive or noxious material, or anything which is likely to cause nuisance to highway users. </p><p>Contents of the skip shall be kept &quot;damped-down&quot;, or covered to prevent dust or spillage on the highway. The skip must not be overloaded and must be removed when full. </p><p>
