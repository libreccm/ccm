    is required from this Authority. A licence is not normally necessary if materials
    are placed on private land. All materials must be placed on private land
    whenever possible.</i></p><hr/><p>In order to apply for a building materials licence, you must complete an

		</p><p>A licence can be valid for any period between 1 day and 1 month. For longer periods, 
  additional applications must be made prior to the expiry of the current licence.</p><p>Permission is granted with the issuing of a licence number. The application form 
  will be returned to you with the number, or, it can be obtained by telephone, normally 
  within 2 working days of receipt of the application.</p><p>If it is not possible to avoid using the public highway, materials should be placed 
  in the carriageway, rather than the footway. If permission is granted to place materials 
  on a footway or grass verge, an amount of <span class="gen">enter amount</span>  deposit is payable to cover any damage which may be caused.</p><p>A single licence allows for the storage of materials, not exceeding 3 metres in 
  length, 1.5 metres in width and 1.0 metre in height. Please consult this office 
  if larger quantities are involved.</p><p>Materials placed in, or partly on, the carriageway require at least four traffic 
  cones on the approach side to guide traffic past the storage area.</p><p>During the hours of darkness, in poor daytime visibility and bad weather, road 
  danger lamps (flashing amber) must be placed to indicate the area of the site. If 
  sited in the carriageway, a lamp should be placed between each cone. More information 
  about the regulations for skips on the highway.</p><p>If this authority's contractors are called out to lamp the site or make it safe, 
  a charge will follow.</p><p>Building materials placed on the highway shall <strong>not</strong> obstruct or interfere with the 
  drainage of the street or with any apparatus of the public utility companies.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
