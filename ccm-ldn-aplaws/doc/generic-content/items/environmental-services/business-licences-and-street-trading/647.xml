A 'public place' is a 'place where the public has access'. </i></p><hr/><p>It is often assumed that collections can be held in shop doorways or car parks do not need and Street Collection Licence because they are being held on 'privately owned land'. This is not true, as the legislation does not mention the ownership of the land or treat collections on 'privately owned land' as exempt from the licensing regulations. A shop doorway or carpark, when that shop is open for trading, is a 'public place' because the public has access at that time. No other licence would be valid. A Pedlars Licence, issued by the Police cannot be used for this purpose. Only Local Authorities issue Street Collection Licences under Section 5 of the Police, Factories, etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1916, as amended by the Local Government Act 1972 and Schedule 29 of that Act.</p><p>There is no cost for the issuing of consent but there are rules to be followed 
  in applying. Street Collections are usually made by Charities. Collections usually 
  take place in a town centre on busy shopping days. Money is collected in tins. There 
  are regulations, which govern this type of collection. Consents are restricted to 
  enable charities to raise money without their collections clashing with those of 
  other charities. </p><p>The purpose of the legal requirement to obtain consent is to ensure collectors 
  are properly authorised and that money is collected in a secure way and the total 
  proceeds collected are properly accounted for.</p><p>A copy of the Police, Factories, etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1916 can be viewed at the Council Offices where you can also obtain an application form and a copy of our standard conditions. </p><p>Alternatively, <strong>
