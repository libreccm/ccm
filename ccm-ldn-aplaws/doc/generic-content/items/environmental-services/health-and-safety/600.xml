Buildings may become gradually dangerous due to old age, deterioration or settlement, or by more dramatic causes such as storm, explosion, fire or impact by vehicles. All buildings which appear to be dangerous should be reported to the Council who will treat the matter with the utmost urgency.</i></p><hr/><p>If it is considered that a building is immediately dangerous Building Standards can require immediate evacuation and require, or take, any action necessary to protect the public and adjacent property. Such action may involve temporary road closure, barricading, shoring, scaffolding, repairs or demolition.</p><p>Where the building is not immediately dangerous the owner would receive a Notice requiring the property to be made safe within a stated time and, if satisfactory action is not taken, an Enforcement Order may be issued. If this is not complied with, the Council can instruct all necessary works to make the building safe and recover expenses from the owner.</p><p>It is often possible to discuss a dangerous building with its owner in the hope that the matter can be resolved quickly without the Council instructing work on a private property.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
