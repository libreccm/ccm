When the Land Charges officers receive the required information, the replies from the service groupings are collated and completed searches are usually returned to the applicant within 5/6 working days. </p><p>Additional enquiry numbers 17-36 on Part II of the Land Charges Form Con29A relate to matters such as road schemes, public footpaths, planning and environmental service matters. These enquiries are also dispatched to the relevant service groupings for 
  their comments. Stockton on Tees Borough Council no longer replies to drainage enquiries and, therefore, a separate search needs to be sent to Northumbrian Water. The applicant's solicitor will be aware of this service. </p><p>'Expedited Searches' require an additional fee. We aim to return a standard expedited search within <span class="gen">enter amount here</span>hours of receipt. Those urgent searches with additional enquiries will however take longer to complete, therefore, additional enquiries are not accepted with 'expedited searches'.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
