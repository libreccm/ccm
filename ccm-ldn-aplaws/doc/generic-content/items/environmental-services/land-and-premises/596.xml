Without this variability in the living world, ecological systems and functions would break down, with detrimental consequences for all forms of life, the impacts of which are impossible to predict. Consequently, biodiversity is essential to ensuring the basic ecological services and resources necessary to sustain the well-being, not only of current, but also future generations (World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1992).</i></p><hr/><p>It is vital that biodiversity is recognised and valued as well as protected. The Earth's biological diversity benefits man through its intrinsic, ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values.</p><p>Conserving biodiversity is one arm of the quest for sustainable development. The concept of conducting biodiversity audits arose as a result of the UK Government's political commitment to sustainable development. Sustainable development has been defined in recent years as &quot;development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&quot;.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
