Ensuing legislation culminated in the Water Industry Act 1991. </i></p><hr/><p>The current national position
    is that hydrant installations are inspected and tested using the procedure
    details in the Home Office Technical Bulletin
1/1994 (Section 14): </p><p>Hydrants shall be subject
		    to a periodic test and/or inspection at intervals to be determined by the
		    brigade taking into account relevant factors such as the location and likely
	    use of the hydrant.</p><h2> Periodic
		  Test and/or Inspection </h2><p> The visual inspection
		    shall pay attention to the hydrant pit, frame, cover, the surface surrounding
		    the hydrant and the frost valve if fitted. The hydrant indicator plate shall
		    also be checked. <br/>
			<br/>
        The hydrant test shall be conducted by fitting a standpipe to the outlet and
	      then partially opening the valve to allow a small amount of water to flow.
	      A blank cap shall then be fitted in the standpipe head, or the valve in the
	      head closed, and the hydrant fully opened. <br/>
			<br/>
        All joints shall be visually inspected for any signs of leakage. <br/>
			<br/>
        The hydrant shall be shut off and the standpipe removed with the blank cap
	      in place or the valve still closed. <br/>
			<br/>
			<strong>Note</strong>: Where it is considered necessary to conduct
				    initial or periodic flow tests on hydrants, it is important to liaise
				    with the appropriate Water Authority. </p><p>Such tests are carried
    out on a regular basis, the interval of inspection being left to individual
              fire authorities
        to determine. The agreed practice, prior to the publication of this Bulletin,
        was that included in the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers'; Association
        (CACFOA) proposed draft Agreement between Water Service Companies and
        fire authorities with testing normally carried out on an
annual basis. </p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
