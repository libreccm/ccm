Namely, these are The Fire Precautions (Workplace Regulations) 1997 (as Amended) or The Fire Precautions Act 1971. </i></p><hr/><p>Basically, larger premises
    will be covered by the Fire Precautions Act and the 'Workplace Regulations'. In the case of smaller premises, they
  have to comply with the requirements of the 'Workplace Regulations'</p><p>The Criteria is detailed
  below.</p><h2>  Who should apply?</h2><p>An
            Application for a fire certificate is required under the Fire Precautions
            Act 1971 as amended by the Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sport
            Act 1987 in respect of any premises which are put to a use designated
            by Order made by the Secretary of State under section 1 of the Act.
            Orders have so far been made relating to hotels and boarding houses,
      factories, offices, shops and railway premises.</p><h2>Hotels and Boarding Houses 

</h2><p> A fire certificate is required for any premises used as a hotel or boarding house if sleeping accommodation is provided for more than 6 persons (whether guests or staff) or there is some sleeping accommodation above the first floor or below the ground floor.   </p><h2>Where do I send the application for a Fire Certificate to?                </h2><p>If
            your premises need a fire certificate, the application form should
      be completed and sent to:</p><p>
			<span class="gen">enter address</span>
		</p><h2>Who should complete the Application Form  </h2><p>The
            occupier of premises should complete the application form and send
            it to the fire authority (or in the case of Crown owned or occupied
            premises, to HM Inspector of Fire Services). If, however, the premises
            are factory, office, shop or railway premises and are held under
            a lease and consist of part of a building, all parts of which are
            in the same ownership, or consist of part of a building in which
            different parts are owned by different people, the Fire Precautions
            Act 1971, as modified, makes the owner(s) of the building responsible
            if the premises are used without a fire certificate being in force.
            Thus in such cases application should be made on behalf of the owner(s)
            of the building and the occupier(s) must supply information as appropriate
            to the owner(s). The occupiers of such premises are advised to check
            that a fire certificate is in force or that an application has been
      made for one.</p><p>
