Stopping fires from starting requires the community and the fire service to work together to deliver safer communities.</i></p><hr/><h2>Vehicle Fires</h2><ul>
		<li title="*">65% of car fires are started deliberately 
      to cover criminal activity, to make a fraudulent insurance claim or as an 
      act of vandalism. </li>
		<li title="*">One in 12 reported stolen vehicles will be 
      set on fire.</li>
		<li title="*">Many other vehicle fires break out simply 
      due to lack of basic maintenance and can be prevented.</li>
		<li title="*">Emphasis should be placed on security of vehicle 
      and safe parking.</li>
      		<li title="*">Report abandoned vehicles
        to the police. Most  Metropolitan areas operate a vehicle removal scheme.</li>
		</ul><p>
<strong>Safety check for vehicles:</strong>
</p><ul>
        <li title="*">
          Electrical, check
              wiring for signs of wear or damage. 
        </li>
        <li title="*">
          Petrol, routinely
              check all fuel lines for signs of wear.
        </li>
        <li title="*">
          Welding, never
              use heat, naked flames or welding equipment near the fuel tank
              or fuel lines.

    </ul><h2>Refuse Skips, Wheelie Bins, Bonfires And Void Properties   </h2><p>
<strong>Refuse Skips:</strong>
</p><ul>
		<li title="*">Place skips at least 10 metres 
      from buildings.</li>
		<li title="*">Ensure that rubbish is place in 
      the skip and not left on the ground nearby.</li>
		<li title="*">Waste packing and pallets should 
      be removed as soon as possible.</li>
		<li title="*">Full skips should be removed as 
      soon as possible.</li>
		<li title="*">Do not leave full skips over weekends 
      or holiday periods.</li>
		<li title="*">Do not
        block fire exits.</li>
		<li title="*">Ensure skips are placed in a designated 
      area.</li>
		<li title="*">Do not store combustible waste 
      within 2 metres of any perimeter fences.</li>
		<li title="*">Fires in wheelie bins can spread to surrounding 
      property</li>
      		<li title="*">Do not overfill wheelie bins or place loose 
      rubbish around them.</li>
		<li title="*">Wheelie bins should only be put out when a 
      collection is due.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Private Bonfires:</strong>
</p><ul>
		<li title="*">Our advice is to attend an organised bonfire 
      if possible.</li>
		<li title="*">Bonfires should be built at least 18 metres 
      from any buildings, trees, fences etc.</li>
		<li title="*">They should be no more than 3 metres high 
      for private events and should not be built under overhead cables.</li>
		<li title="*">Do not use petrol or any other flammable liquid 
      to start a bonfire.</li>
		<li title="*">Always check inside the bonfire for animals 
      and children who could be using them as a den.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Void Properties:</strong>
</p><ul>
		<li title="*">Void Properties are a magnet for youths, drug 
      takers and homeless people who often light fires inside to keep warm, often 
      leading to the property catching fire.</li>
		<li title="*">Ensure that any void property notified to 
      you is secured as soon as possible.</li>
</ul><h2>Organised Bonfires and Firework
Displays</h2><ul>
		<li title="*">Running a display
        takes a lot of work, so  try to share the load by planning ahead.</li>
		<li title="*">Set up a committee whose members can each 
      take responsibility for a particular task (including one person to be in 
      charge of all safety arrangements).</li>
		<li title="*">Arrange for fire extinguishers, buckets of 
      water, buckets of sand and metal litter bins to be available on the night.</li>
		<li title="*">Check that plenty of electric torches will 
      be available on the night, with full batteries.</li>
		<li title="*">Publicise the fact that spectators are not 
      allowed to bring their own fireworks (including sparklers).</li>
		<li title="*">Draw up a detailed checklist of tasks and 
      indicate who is to be responsible for each one.</li>
		<li title="*">Check whether you are adequately insured to 
      cover any firework-related injuries to those present at the display.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Picking the right location:</strong>
</p><p>You should choose a large, clear and well mown 
  area free from obstructions, well away from any buildings, trees and hazards 
  like overhead cables, with as many safe entrances and exits as possible.</p><p>  These must be:</p><ul>
		<li title="*">Away from the firing area and dropping zone.</li>
		<li title="*">Allow at least 50m x 20m for your firing area.</li>
		<li title="*">Beyond this you will need a dropping zone 
      for spent fireworks of 100m x 50m in the downwind direction.</li>
		<li title="*">Spectators should be kept back on the opposite 
      side to the dropping zone at least 25m from the firing area.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Proper
  crowd control is essential and needs good planning:</strong>
</p><ul>
  		<li title="*">Arrange for some stewards.</li>
		<li title="*">Take great care at all times.</li>
		<li title="*">Plan your display in advance.</li>
		<li title="*">Do not allow smoking.</li>
		<li title="*">Before lighting any firework, read the instructions 
      on it carefully (by torchlight).</li>
		<li title="*">Make sure that the wind blows away from spectators. </li>
		<li title="*">The display should be angled away from spectators.</li>
		<li title="*">Never use matches or lighters for lighting 
      fire works at a display.</li>
		<li title="*">A sudden change of wind could cause aerial 
      fireworks to fall dangerously among spectators.</li>
		<li title="*">In very windy weather you should consider 
      putting off the display altogether, however disappointing that might be.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Bonfires need planning too:</strong>
</p><ul>
		<li title="*">Bonfires need a lot of organising.</li>
		<li title="*">Don't site it too near your display or firework 
      storage area. And don't site it anywhere near fences or trees.</li>
		<li title="*">Never use flammable liquids like paraffin 
      or petrol to get it going, as this can result in uncontrolled spread of 
      fire or explosion.</li>
		<li title="*">Check immediately before lighting that there 
      is no animal or a young child hidden inside.</li>
		<li title="*">Don't burn dangerous
        rubbish (eg. aerosols,  paint tins or foam filled furniture).</li>
		<li title="*">Remove any rubbish from your bonfire area 
      in advance so nothing can be thrown onto the fire on the night.</li>
</ul><h2>After the event.</h2><p>The bonfire needs to be put out completely before 
  you leave the site. Information is available from the

		<li title="*">Make sure your fire alarm is tested weekly.</li>
		<li title="*">Inform your staff of what to do in the event 
      of a fire, make sure they are familiar with the evacuation drill and escape 
      routes for the building.</li>
		<li title="*">Make sure you carry out a continuous Fire 
      Risk assessment of your building.</li>
		<li title="*">Never obstruct sprinkler heads and fire detectors.</li>
		<li title="*">Unsafe storage of waste packaging and pallets 
      is a fire risk, never leave waste containers close to buildings.</li>
		<li title="*">Guard all sources of ignition.</li>
		<li title="*">Ensure that Flammable Liquids are stored safely.</li>
