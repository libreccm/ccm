As part of this role, we visit a number of premises every year. </i></p><hr/><p>If your workplace is selected for a visit you will be required to present a fire risk assessment and emergency plan to one of our fire safety officers and explain the contents. If, when we visit, you have not completed a fire risk assessment you may have committed an offence under the fire regulations and we may take action. </p><p>  If you have made your assessment but we think you need to take further precautions, we will discuss these with you and highlight the general areas of concern. </p><p>  It is, however, the employer's duty to identify and take appropriate measures to comply with the regulations. </p><p>  We have formal powers that can be used in serious cases: these include the ability to prohibit, with immediate effect, the use of all or part of your premises. </p><p>  We also have the power to serve an 'enforcement notice', requiring you to take steps to comply with the regulations. Failure to comply with the regulations, in a way that places one or more employees at risk or death or serious injury in case of fire, is a criminal offence in itself - in such cases we may prosecute in the 
  courts.
