However, equipment will only be offered after an assessment of need has been made by a Care Manager (occupational therapy) or through your GP. Please contact us using the details above for more information regarding loaning specialist equipment.</p><h3>How much will it cost?</h3><p>Any equipment, which the Social Services department can loan you to help around the home, is available free of charge. However, our supplies are limited, and for some equipment for example, lifting equipment or high chairs, there is a waiting list.</p><p>Should you wish to purchase your own equipment, the Social Services department will still be able to offer you advice as to which particular pieces of equipment suit your needs. Professional advice from a care manager (occupational therapy) can help you avoid costly mistakes to your pocket and your health.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
