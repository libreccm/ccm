Your health visitor, teacher or community group can also offer other forms of family support. </i></p><hr/><p>Bringing up children is 
  exciting and enjoyable but it is also demanding, tiring and stressful. We all 
  need help at times as none of us are trained to be parents. Social Services 
  can offer support and services to your children and you as parents and carers 
  and we will work alongside others offering you support in your community.</p><h2>Family Support - Who is Eligible?</h2><p>To receive family support, an assessment of your child and families needs will 
  have taken place to ensure that Social Services are best placed to meet these 
  needs. Your involvement in this assessment is important, as it is our aim to 
  support you to safely parent your child.</p><h2>Family Support - What help 
  can we offer?</h2><ul>
			<li title="*">Support 
      to your family to enable you to live together better.</li>
			<li title="*">Opportunities 
      for you as parents and carers to learn new skills.</li>
			<li title="*">Opportunities 
      for young children to learn through play.</li>

      respond to those needs.</li>
			<li title="*">Support and services 
        that work with you to protect your children from harm.</li>
		</ul><h2>Family Support - How we provide 
  it</h2><ul>
			<li title="*">By talking 
      to you and your children to find out what services might be best for you.</li>
			<li title="*">By offering 
      a mixture of services to suit your particular family.</li>
			<li title="*">Recognising 
      that you and your children have multi-cultural, religious and linguistic 
      needs.</li>
			<li title="*">Working 
      in partnership with you to recognise that as parents you have prime responsibility 
      for your children.</li>
			<li title="*">To signpost 
      you to other community services.</li>
			<li title="*">For 
      those children who are not able to live together with you at home, we will 
      work with you to assess how to safely return your children home.</li>
			<li title="*">It is our priority 
        to offer support to enable you and your family to live safely together.</li>
		</ul><h2>Family Support - Teenagers 
  </h2><p>Having a teenager at home 
  can be challenging for both you as a parent and the young person. It is a time 
  when young people begin to want control over their lives and need to learn how 
  to take responsibility for their actions. It can be a rollercoaster of emotions 
  and make family life a time of conflict, stress and worry.</p><p>We can offer advice and 
  support, including individual work with the young person.</p><p>The aim is to support you 
  as a family and prevent any family breakdown.</p><h2>Your Involvement</h2><p>Social Services is committed 
  to working in partnership to enable you to parent your children so that they 
  reach their full potential. This includes:</p><ul>
			<li title="*">information: 
      on assessments and services</li>
			<li title="*">consultation: 
      you and your families views are considered in the provision of services</li>
			<li title="*">involvement 
      in planning and decision making: active participation is encouraged in drawing 
      up the plan for your child.</li>
