You may not live in the same house, and you do not have to be related to the person you look after. </i></p><hr/><p>The Carers Act (1995) gives carers rights in law and it is important that you are aware of these rights and how they can be used. It gives carers the right to request an assessment of their own abilities and needs when an assessment of the needs of the person they care for is being carried out. The assessment applies to both adults and children who are carers. Your Social Worker or Occupational Therapist will take the results of this assessment into account when deciding what services you may be entitled to receive.</p><p>
				Most people who look after 
  relations or friends are happy to do so, but sometimes they need help and support 
  to continue providing care. The information here aims to give carers an idea 
  of the range of services available to them, and who to contact for further information; 
  it is not a complete guide to services. Once you have made contact with any 
  of the organisations or people listed here, they will give you a more detailed 
  picture of the help available to suit your individual needs.
