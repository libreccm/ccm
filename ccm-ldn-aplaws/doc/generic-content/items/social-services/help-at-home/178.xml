  <li title="*">have a disability</li>
  <li title="*">or are elderly</li>
  <li title="*">or have a long term illness which causes you to have difficulties coping with daily living tasks</li>
</ul><p>we may be able to help you. </p><p>If you or your partner or a friend contact us using the details above, we will arrange a convenient time for someone from the Council to visit you to talk about what you need.</p><h3>What kind of help is there?</h3><ul>
  <li title="*">We can advise on suitable equipment for you or adaptations for your home that will meet your needs.</li>
  <li title="*">We may be able to supply some equipment on loan; for example, a raised toilet seat or bathing equipment. There is a small charge for this.</li>
  <li title="*">We can recommend minor adaptations to your home, like stair rails or outside hand rails, which will be carried out at a small charge.</li>
  <li title="*">If we feel that major adaptations are needed, such as a lift or a ramp for wheelchair access, we can discuss how these can be funded.</li>
  <li title="*">We want to help you live independently in your present home. But if we, or you, feel that you would be better off moving to different accommodation, we will discuss all the options with you.</li>
</ul><p>Everyone's needs are different so the services offered to each individual will be different. Together we will try to agree on the best way to provide the help that you need.</p><p>Please contact us using the details above for more details.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
