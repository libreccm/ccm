It enables people with disabilities to carry out essential activities, with the aim of maintaining or improving independence.</i></p><hr/><p>Occupation means any way in which people spend their time from personal care (washing, dressing, toileting) to productivity (paid or unpaid work, housework, education); to leisure (games, sports, hobbies, social activities).</p><p>Examples of essential activities may include:</p><ul>
			<li title="*">Managing personal care, e.g. getting to the bathroom and transferring on/off toilet.</li>
			<li title="*">Safe mobility around your home to enable you to prepare meals, get in/out of bed, manage the steps and stairs.</li>
			<li title="*">Enabling an individual to take up or stay in paid or unpaid work.</li>
			<li title="*">Enabling your carer to care for you.</li>
		</ul><p>OTs could help, or provide information about:</p><ul>
			<li title="*">Raising the height of the bed/chair so that standing is much easier if a person has stiff, painful hips and knees.</li>
			<li title="*">Making a home safer for getting around by the installation, for instance, of hand rails and ramps.</li>
			<li title="*">Reducing anxiety and helping people raise their confidence about getting around or manage their disability.</li>
			<li title="*">Information on ways of obtaining appropriate support and helping people to connect to other relevant agencies.</li>
			<li title="*">Assisting carers to continue to maintain their caring responsibilities.</li>
