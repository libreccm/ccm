			Caring and Employment</h3><p>Almost two thirds of working age Carers are in some sort of paid employment. A third of those work full-time and provide care for more than 20 hours per week. Combining work and caring can be difficult. The Carer on occasion may have to take time off work to look after the person in need when an emergency occurs. The Government has acknowledged the importance of the Carer being able to do this and at the same time have their rights to employment protected.</p><h3>The Right to Have Time Off</h3><p>The Employment Relations Act of 15/12/1999 gave Carers in paid work the right to have time off to deal with a family emergency. Carers cannot now by law be penalised by their employer for taking time off so long as that time off is fully justified. 
  Further information on 'time off' can be found at: <strong>

		</p><h3>Work-Life Balance Campaign</h3><p>In March 2000 the Prime Minister launched the government's Work-Life Balance campaign. This was to encourage employers to recognise the benefits to their organisation of flexible working arrangements and the responsibility that Carers have out of work.</p><p>The campaign is for everyone, whether you are an employer, Carer, parent or jobseeker. It is about changing working patterns so that everyone can find a way to help them combine work with 'out of work' responsibilities. More information can be found

		</p><h3>Promoting the Inclusion of Carers into Employment</h3><p>Carers Online report on an 'Action for Carers and Employment' National UK project whose aim is to promote Carers inclusion into the labour market?</p><p>Nearly three million Carers juggle paid work and care - that is one in seven people in the workforce - and many have to reduce the hours they work or give up work altogether. Keeping a job, or returning to a job when caring has ended can mean facing significant barriers such as:</p><ul>
			<li title="*">Loss of confidence and work skills</li>
			<li title="*">Invisibility to mainstream services such as JobCentre Plus</li>
			<li title="*">Finding good quality, flexible and affordable alternative care</li>

			Education for people with Special Needs</h3><p>
			<strong>What are Special Needs?</strong>
		</p><p>A person has special needs when they have:</p><ul>
			<li title="*">A physical disability</li>
			<li title="*">A problem with sight, hearing or speech</li>
			<li title="*">A mental disability</li>
			<li title="*">Emotional or behavioural problems</li>
			<li title="*">A medical or health problem</li>

		</ul><p>
			<strong>Special Needs and Education</strong>
		</p><p>In September 2002 the Disability Discrimination Act Part IV came into effect making it illegal for disabled children and students in education to be less favourably treated. Providers of education have to make sure where reasonably possible that disabled learners are no longer disadvantaged. The law covers all areas of education such as schools, colleges, universities, adult education and youth services.</p><p>Literature and advice for disabled people, parents and others is available free from the <strong>
