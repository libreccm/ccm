    people will need trauma support in the immediate aftermath of such an incident but in a 
    short time they will have recovered sufficiently to readjust to some sort of normality. 
    Some, however, will need a higher level of trauma support for some time after the incident 
    and a few will continue to need this support over many years. </p><p>We provide a range of social and 
psychological support services in the aftermath of a major incident affecting residents 
or visitors.</p><p>We work closely with voluntary and statutory agencies,
