The property, the persons &quot;estate&quot; is divided among members of the family under strict rules contained in the Administration of Estates Act after all bills are paid. </p><p>Wills sound like a very complicated legal process, which tends to make people shirk away from them. In truth a will is a letter of wish of how someone's assets should be distributed in the event of their death. It becomes a little more complicated with children and relatives that 
need to be taken into consideration. </p><p>There is no necessity to have a will drawn up by a solicitor but great care needs to be taken as sorting out an unclear will can lead to long and expensive court cases. There are many books and guides and printed forms available to help you. Nowadays you can download wills from the internet or buy them in a standard format from legal stationers. There are also will writers and advice on-line:</p><ul>

To help those who live on after and to ensure that your property is dealt with as you want it to be you need to make a will. </p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
