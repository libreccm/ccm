There are three terms in the school year. The amount of grant will then be deducted from your bill each term.</p><h4>Level of funding</h4><p>The nursery education grant is currently &#xA3; <span class="gen">enter amount</span> per year. This amounts to &#xA3; <span class="gen">enter amount</span> per term based on a claim for five sessions per week. If your child attends less than five sessions per week the grant will be paid on a pro-rata basis.</p><span class="gen">email address here</span><span class="gen">phone number here</span><span class="gen">sms phone number here</span><span class="gen">fax number here</span><span class="gen">minicom number here</span><span class="gen">postal address here</span><h3>
