The PANDA puts data about a school into a series of tables and charts so that schools can see how effective they are compared with other schools. The PANDA presents comparisons with all schools in England, and also with similar schools.</p><p>The information helps schools to look at their strengths and weaknesses, and is designed to help them develop plans to raise standards. It uses data from DfES alongside information from inspections and is sent to headteachers every autumn. It is also sent to 
		<a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk">OFSTED</a>	 <span class="gen">link to external website</span> inspectors before they inspect a school.</p><p>The format of the PANDA is standard but the data in each one is specific to a particular school. They are widely used because schools can see at a glance how they compare with others, and do not have to calculate their own figures.</p><p>For more information regarding Attainments and Performance, please visit:
