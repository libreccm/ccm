Staff will always be pleased to help you. If you are unable to visit, you may send in a completed Project Loan Form by courier, post or fax, or you may complete the on-line form available on this website. For urgent requests please telephone or e-mail. Your Project Loan will be delivered to your school during the first three weeks of term and collected during the last three weeks. To guarantee delivery, requests must reach us three weeks before the end of the preceding term. Requests may be made at any time after the deadline, but delivery of these cannot be guaranteed.</p><h4>
