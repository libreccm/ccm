It is expected that the majority of these Special Needs are such that they will be met in local mainstream schools without the additional involvement of the Council. </i></p><hr/><p>
				However, some pupils' Special Educational Needs may be such 
  that the Council may consider that some additional or special provision is needed. 
  This will be done in consultation with parents and professionals, and following 
  a full formal assessment.
			</p><p>
				This provision would be made at the local mainstream school, 
  or at a school or unit which has additional resourcing to meet particular needs. 
  As far as possible, the Council seeks to meet pupils' Special Educational Needs 
  in a mainstream setting.
			</p><p>
				In some exceptional cases it may be necessary for placement 
  to be determined at one of the schools listed below, or at specialist schools outside 
  this Council's catchment area.
