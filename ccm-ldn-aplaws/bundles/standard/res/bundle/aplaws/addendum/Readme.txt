This directory contains all the requisite files to make the Aplaws Navigation category tree equivalent to the LGCL category tree.

By default, ANav only contains the first two levels of the LGCL tree (see ../domain-nav-1.03.xml and hierarchy-nav-1.03.xml). This subset can be mapped to the LGCL tree using ../mapping-lgcl-1.03-anav-1.03.xml.

In this directory you will find the following 3 files, which will need to be loaded after the ones mentioned above:

- domain-nav-1.03-addendum.xml
- hierarchy-nav-1.03-addendum.xml
- mapping-lgcl-1.03-anav-1.03-addendum.xml

These were generated using the files in the /make dir.
