MyWorkspacePortlet:
   Code is broken and aborts program flow unrecoverable.
   No documentation at all, seems to create a list of persona√∂ Workspaces.
   Not usefule for PortalWorkspace, as it is meant as a system wide frontpage
   or as leaf for navigation. No option for personal homepages here.
   May be useful for PortalServer and its personal homepages.

WorkspaceNavigatorPortlet
   Code is broken, no documentation at all. Seems to provide a list of child
   Workspaces and related Workspaces. Not useful for PortalWorkspace because
   it is not meant to form a interwoven system of portal pages.
   Portlet of the same name is part of PortalServer where it should be useful.

WorkspaceSummaryPortlet
   Code is broken, no documentation at all. Seems to provide a list of objects,
   probably participants.

All 3 portlets have internal classes to provide a PortletRenderer. XML files
are missing, but the tags may be part of the PortalWorkspace applications XML.
Not checked.
