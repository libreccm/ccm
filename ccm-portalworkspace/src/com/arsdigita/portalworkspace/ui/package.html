<p>
    Classes to compose the PortalWorkspaceuser interface for 
    their  visitors .
</p>

<p>
    The portal pages may be generally (publically) available or
    restricted for registered and logged-in users and may or may
    not require the user to be a member of a specific group. By
    default the public user is sufficient who is automatically
    member of the member group.
</p>

<p>
    The user interface is accessed by a JSPs (in contrast to be
    constructed by a servlet).
</p>

<p>
    The class WorkspaceViewer is the jsp's entry point in view
    mode for readers.
</p>

<p>
    The class WorkspaceEditor is the jsp's entry point for users
    permitted to style the portal page (add, delete, and modify
    portlets).
</p>

<p>
    Package <code>com/arsdigita/portalworkspace/ui/admin</code>
    contains classes for additional administrative tasks (add and
    remove members of access groups, associate a navigation
    category, etc.).
